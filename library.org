* AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS
** /Alan Taylor/

- Contrary to how it's often depicted, the American Revolutionary War wasn't a clear-cut conflict of patriotic Americans against the British. Such a view is meant to prop up nationalistic feelings and emphasize the unity of the thirteen colonies.
- In reality, as the author argues, the Revolutionary War was a bloody conflict of an almost civil war-like character.

#+begin_quote
  /Only by the especially destructive standards of other revolutions was the American more restrained. During the Revolutionary War, Americans killed one another over politics and massacred Indians, who returned the bloody favors. Patriots also kept one-fifth of Americans enslaved, and thousands of those slaves escaped to help the British oppose the revolution. After the war, 60,000 dispossessed Loyalists became refugees. The dislocated proportion of the American population exceeded that of the French in their revolution. The American revolutionary turmoil also inflicted an economic decline that lasted for fifteen years in a crisis unmatched until the Great Depression of the 1930s. During the revolution, Americans suffered more upheaval than any other American generation, save that which experienced the Civil War of 1861 to 1865./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By writing of the American Revolution as pitting “Americans” against the British, historians prematurely find a cohesive, national identity. If we equate Patriots with Americans, we recycle the canard that anyone who opposed the revolution was an alien at heart. We also read American nationalism backwards, obscuring the divisions and uncertainties of the revolutionary era./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /But that upheaval also generated political and cultural creativity. Indeed, the accomplishments of independence, union, and republican government seem all the more remarkable given the grim civil war at the heart of the revolution. The founders had formidable enemies, internal divisions, and their own doubts, fears, and contentions to overcome. If they fell short in producing equality and liberty for all, they established ideals worth striving for./
#+end_quote

- The book also takes a more "Atlantic" and "Continental" approach, instead of the conventional narrative that focuses on the East.

#+begin_quote
  /The founders of the American union understood that they were enmeshed in global networks of trade, culture, diplomacy, and war. As they expected, their actions affected, and were affected by, the rest of the world./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /During the early eighteenth century, the colonies and Britain became more closely intertwined in a shared empire in which political, economic, cultural, and military initiatives came from the great metropolis of London. Imperial success in war and restraint in politics led colonial leaders to glory in the identity of transplanted Englishmen endowed with the same liberties enjoyed by their peers in the mother country. Rather than thinking of themselves as a distinct new people in America, colonists claimed the status of Britons who lived west of the Atlantic./
#+end_quote

- Slave trade and slavery became highly profitable, and millions of Africans were brought to the American colonies in the process. The colonists had little regard for the slaves' welfare, as they could be easily replaced upon death. Their living conditions were intentionally kept abysmal to lower costs.
- In Spanish America, slaves had relatively better standing, and racial hierarchy was less sharp and more fluid. This is due to combination of Roman law, the Catholic Church's influence, and the long history of racial mixing.
- The upper class in British America were known as the "genteel", form which the term "gentleman" (genteel man) derives from.
  
#+begin_quote
  /In the established churches, ministers preached the sacredness of social stability and deference to a hierarchy of authority./

  /Colonial churches assigned pews on the basis of family status, with the most prestigious people sitting closest to the minister. That insistence on ranking and order derived from a pervasive anxiety over status competition and social mobility in British America./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By emphasizing the overwhelming, miraculous, and fundamental power of God acting directly and indiscriminately upon souls, evangelicals weakened the social conventions of their hierarchical society. By insisting that everyone had the right to choose his or her own minister, evangelicals championed individualism, a concept then considered divisive and anarchic. Free choice had radical implications for an unequal society in which husbands commanded wives, fathers dictated to sons, masters owned servants and slaves, and gentlemen claimed deference from common people. Evangelicals argued that no worldly authority should obstruct religious choice, and they charged that great wealth and power rendered men too proud to humble themselves before God: the prerequisite for salvation by a new birth./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Rejecting the traditional conviction that society should unite under one church, evangelicals promoted a more pluralistic, egalitarian, and voluntary social order. Their itinerant preachers and converts sought freely to cross community and denominational lines. The evangelical style influenced the younger ministers in established churches, for they had to compete to retain parishioners, who liked to sample a range of preachers. Evangelical values prepared many colonists to seek a new society premised on individualism and voluntary association./
#+end_quote

- The colonies were supposed to be mirrored from the mainland British political system, where a monarch rules over a parliament divided into two chambers: for the aristocrats (House of Lords) and for the general populace (House of Commons). The colonies, for this purpose, have an appointed governor, a council, and a representative assembly.
- In reality, this system barely functioned the way intended. Governors rule for only a few years and scarcely familiar with their constituencies. The councilors did not hold as much wealth and influence as titled aristocrats in Britain. The assemblies held disproportionately greater power, as a larger percentage of people have properties compared with mainland Britain.

#+begin_quote
  /Britons and British Americans shared an identity defined against the Catholic French and Spanish, cast as economically backward, religiously superstitious, culturally decadent, and submissive to despotic rule. By contrast, Britons felt especially blessed and enlightened by commerce, civil liberties, the common law, and their Protestant faith./
#+end_quote

- Though the British won the Seven Years War, it came at the cost of getting saddled by higher colonial expenses and increased debt.

#+begin_quote
  /After the triumphant war, colonists expected a privileged position as Britons in America. Instead, to their horror, imperial reformers sought a more centralized empire./
#+end_quote

- The Pontiac Rebellion further hardened colonist sentiment against the natives. The colonists retaliated and on several instances massacred native Indians.

#+begin_quote
  /British officers concluded that settlers, rather than Indians, posed the greatest threat to imperial peace and order on the frontier. Determined to avoid another expensive war, British officials sought to protect natives from settlers. While colonists drew a harder racial line against Indians, Britons felt a new sympathy for them./

  /But colonists longed to crush and dispossess native peoples, if only the British would get out of the way./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Natives reserved most of their domains for hunting game and gathering roots, herbs, and berries. Men hunted, fished, and built cabins, while women tended crops of corn, beans, and squash planted near their  villages. Lacking courts, jails, bureaucracies, and professional armies, the Indian nations were communities of extended kin. Native nations subdivided into many scattered villages, each with several, competing chiefs who led rival clans. Natives preferred dispersed, weak, and competitive leadership as the best guarantor of their cherished freedom./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Imperial officials blamed unregulated expansion and land speculation for provoking expensive Indian wars and clashes between landlords and settlers. Imperialists also distrusted colonial leaders who benefited from speculation and expansion. Lacking aristocratic origins, leading colonists were relative upstarts and strivers apparently driven by greed and ambition to defy any restraints sought by the empire./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Imperial measures seemed to threaten the landed interests and ambitions of leading colonists, but the Crown lacked the means to enforce its reforms. By withdrawing troops from the backcountry while escalating its pretensions to control settlers and speculators, the British created a credibility gap. Imperial measures combined potential threat with real impotence. That combination rendered the empire irritating yet contemptible to colonists who wanted to profit from westward expansion./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Patriots struggled against the double challenge of British taxes and popular discontent. They dreaded losing power over the common colonists to an empire that seized control over revenue and access to frontier land. Worse still, a triumphant empire might deploy Indian allies as frontier enforcers. Although the empire was, in fact, losing that control, its robust pretensions sufficed to scare Patriots into uniting to complete the collapse of imperial authority in the West, where farms, fortunes, and futures were made./
#+end_quote

- Even in the early 18th century there have already been rumblings about the British Parliament imposing its authority over colonists' assemblies, which the latter hold to be co-equal with the former.
- Taxes on sugar have been enforced by Parliament on the colonies in the 18th century, but the general response has been muted resentment from the colonists. There was an assumption that another tax could be passed and the opposition will still remain minimal. So in 1765, Parliament passed a stamp tax for the colonies.
- The stamp tax instead garnered widespread anger and protests. The colonies are still reeling from postwar depression, and many people are already saddled with economic hardships.

#+begin_quote
  /British leaders had expected little resistance from the diverse mainland colonies with their deep suspicions of one another. But the Stamp Act touched a raw nerve, their aversion to taxes imposed by Parliament, so the crisis generated unprecedented intercolonial communication and cooperation./
#+end_quote

- Colonists appealed to King George III for help to rein in Parliament. The King sacked PM Grenville, and in 1766 Parliament repealed the stamp tax.
- On the other hand, as they repealed the tax, Parliament also issued a Declaratory Act, which asserts their sovereign authority over the colonies. The repeal of the tax was widely celebrated in the colonies; the Declaratory Act was received with minimal fanfare.
- Subsequent tax on some imported goods also garnered widespread protest. This time, boycotts were enforced by a riotous group known as Sons of Liberty, which resorted to violence and intimidation to prevent the trading of boycotted goods.
- The import duties were subsequently repealed, except for tea. For the most part, this was received with minimal protesting. Consumers largely circumvented this by going for smuggled tea from the Dutch East Indies instead.
- Parliament tried to undercut the smuggling by imposing smaller taxes for tea from the British East India Company. This angered the merchants who make money from the smuggled tea. A mob boarded a Company ship docked in Boston port and dumped all its tea on the waters.
- In 1774, Patriot leaders gathered in Philadelphia to convene a First Continental Congress, which coordinated response against the British. The Congress formed a mass boycott system called Continental Association. Towns were called to form their committees of inspection that identified people who refuse to follow the boycott.
- The Continental Association resulted in violators being shamed and intimidated, and townsfolk were encouraged to police their neighbors to make sure they comply with the boycott.

#+begin_quote
  /Patriots defended freedom for white men while asserting their domination over enslaved blacks. Patriots understood that dominion in defensive terms, as meant to secure their liberty and property from slaves allegedly manipulated by the British. In the South, the enslaved sought a greater revolution, for they meant to “Alter the World” and regarded Britons, rather than Patriots, as the better champions of true liberty. Although the British performance as liberators lagged far behind the wishful hopes of the enslaved, they could find no better ally./
#+end_quote

- Despite the open armed conflict between the Patriots and the Loyalists, well into 1776 the Continental Congress still rejected independence. Thomas Paine's pamphlet, Common Sense, was instrumental in swaying the Patriots to the side of independence.

#+begin_quote
  /Unlike previous political pamphleteers who wrote in a learned and legalistic style, Paine addressed common people in direct and forceful prose./

  /Avoiding the arcane works of political philosophers, Paine quoted only the Bible: the primary text known and revered by his intended readers. For Paine, style was also substance, for he sought to constitute a new readership: a broad and engaged public for a republican revolution. He insisted that common people should no longer defer to gentlemen in politics. Aptly titled, Common Sense spoke to and for common people./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Paine pushed for immediate independence, a union of thirteen states, and republican governments for those states. All three goals broke dramatically with past experience and received wisdom. No colonies in the Americas had yet revolted from their mother empire; past bickering by the colonies augured poorly for a union; and almost all former republics in Europe had been small, contentious, and short-lived. In a daring stroke, Paine argued that Americans could triumph by combining all three gambles: on independence, union, and republic. Seeking one alone would certainly fail, but the combination would prove invincible. If united in a righteous cause, he insisted, Americans could crush the corrupt mercenaries of a royal tyrant./
#+end_quote

- Of the thirteen colonies, twelve voted for independence on 2 July 1776. New York initially abstained, but voted in favor a week later.
- The Declaration of Independence was formally adopted and published on 4 July 1776. It was ordered disseminated, and the document itself being short enough to fit a newpaper page helped publishing it much easier.

#+begin_quote
  /A popular myth casts the revolution as waged by a united American people against British rule. That myth derives from Patriot claims to speak for all true Americans, dismissing Loyalists as a deluded few corrupted by the British./

  /After the revolution triumphed, nationalist historians endorsed the Patriot view, marginalizing or ignoring Loyalists to concoct a unifying American identity. In fact, the revolution divided families and neighborhoods./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Revolutions breed civil wars: triangular struggles in which two sides compete for civilian support./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By sorting Americans into Loyalists and Patriots, we suggest that individuals made quick and definitive decisions based on political principles. Some did, but many more committed slowly, reluctantly, and provisionally./

  /Choosing sides in a civil war was painful and confusing for rural folk, who rarely read a pamphlet or saw a newspaper. People balked at the risks of clear allegiance: exposing their farms to looters, suffering the hardships of a military camp or political prison, or killing others and risking death in combat./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Political choices were often unstable and temporary. The ebb and flow of victory and defeat in a long war flipped many people from one side to another and sometimes back again with sojourns along the way in the broad ranks of the wavering. Many profited by selling their produce or services to the likely victors: a probability which changed as one force surged at the expense of the other. More often, people acted defensively, switching sides to save farms and lives from the power of the ascendant party./
#+end_quote

- People were intimidated, pressured, threatened, even killed, for simply being neutral, or just being disaffected and not wanting to get into the conflict.
- The author is really trying to drive home the point that the Patriots demanded unity under their banner and rooted out opposition, by hook and by crook.

#+begin_quote
  /Popular history books dwell on the big battles between formal armies and treat the conflict as relatively restrained. That approach neglects the broader and more vicious war conducted by many small raiding parties, composed of a mix of regulars and irregulars, militia and bandits. They ravaged farms and towns to take forage, livestock, clothing, and silver, and they kidnapped or killed the partisans of the other side./
#+end_quote

- Even prior to the Revolutionary Wars, the colonists already have a tense relationship with the native Indian settlers especially in the west of the 13 colonies. The colonists sought to push westwards little by little, laying claim on native lands for speculation.
- The war further deteriorated the situation, as many Indian tribes sided with the Europeans. This also amde the colonists more determined to stamp out the Indian settlements once and for all.

#+begin_quote
  /Spain’s empire remained overstretched and internally volatile. Like the British, the Spanish had imposed reforms meant to rationalize and centralize control, undermining the local power long enjoyed by elite colonists. Unlike the British, the Spanish succeeded in imposing their taxes, more than doubling Crown revenues. Emboldened by success, imperial rulers issued grandiose dictates, which commanded colonial officials to impose tighter control over natives and colonists./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /While waging war in the east against British rule, Patriots fought west of the Appalachians to suppress the independence of native peoples. Patriots meant to create an “empire of liberty” premised on the ability of common whites to obtain private property by taking land from Indians./

  /Jefferson understood the paradoxical lesson that had eluded the British: an empire in America could only hope to appear strong by facilitating the wishes of its citizens, who wanted cheap and fertile land taken as quickly as possible from natives. American leaders needed to ride, rather than resist, the settler wave heading west. While the revolution had western roots, it would also bear western consequences but only after a generous peace treaty rescued the United States./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The French and Spanish could sustain larger forces in the Caribbean in part because they more readily enlisted and armed free blacks. These empires also had more free blacks to recruit because the Catholic church and their laws encouraged manumissions. A quarter of the blacks in Spanish America were free, compared to less than a twentieth in the British West Indies. More pragmatic in tincturing their racism, the Spanish and French recognized that an armed and intermediary caste of free blacks tended to secure, rather than imperil, the slave system. Struggling to defend their islands, Britons paid a premium to cling to especially rigid racial prejudices./
#+end_quote

- The war left the French with negligible benefits, and saddled them with large debts. The crisis caused by the national debt would lead to the convening of the Estates General in 1789, and will set in motion two decades of war and revolution in Europe.
- When the Revolutionary Wars ended, there was suspicion spread by the British that Washington would rule as a military dictator, like Julius Caesar and Cromwell. Instead, in 1783 Washington voluntarily resigned his commission before the Congress in Annapolis, Maryland.
- After the Wars, Loyalist refugees were violently prevented from resettling into the 13 colonies. They dispersed throughout the other remaining colonies especially in British Canada.
- In 1781, the thirteen colonies agreed to establish a confederation, the United States of America. The centralizing Congress, however, had little authority over the individual states, which retained their powers.

#+begin_quote
  /Fertile but roiled by violence, the West fed both short-term pessimism and long-term optimism for the American union. In the vast, western lands drained by navigable rivers, Americans detected a great source of wealth and power. But Indians defended those lands, and federal leaders struggled to control their own settlers. In sum, the West promised either to enrich or to unravel the fragile union./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Thomas Jefferson drafted the first “Northwest Ordinance,” which Congress provisionally adopted in April 1784. It subdivided the federal domain into ten territories and stipulated that, once any one had 20,000 free citizens, they could convene a convention to draft a republican constitution and send a delegate to Congress. When the settler population reached the threshold of the smallest original state, Rhode Island, the territory could join the union as an equal partner in its powers and share in the national debt. While holding out future statehood, the ordinance bought time for the federal government to sell land within the territories./
#+end_quote

- The fledgling United States' desire to push westwards pitted the newly-settled Americans in the Federal domain against the native Indians. The Congress was too weak and powerless to diffuse the tensions between the warring settlers and natives. In addition, British and Spanish colonies also checked the United States' expansionist policies.
  
#+begin_quote
  /Republicanism inflated the aspirations of common men, who grumbled when wealthy gentlemen continued to grab the largest land grants, top commands, highest offices, and best contracts. Common folk also bore the greatest sacrifices and hardships of the war. As the conflict dragged on, they resented their increasing burdens from taxes and militia service. They blamed leaders for waging a rich mans war by making it a poor man's fight. The republican promise of equal opportunity invited the dissatisfied to seek more sweeping reforms meant to reduce the power and privileges of genteel leaders./
#+end_quote

- Part of the need for state constitutions is to avoid the political corruption that the Patriots deem to have stemmed from British Empire having an /unwritten/ constitution.

#+begin_quote
  /By modern standards, the new state governments were not all that democratic. Although two-thirds of white men could vote for the assembly, they comprised less than a third of all adults because women, black people, and the poorest whites lacked civil rights. Most states also mandated an even stricter property qualification that precluded 90 percent of men from serving as a state senator or governor./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Unlike democrats, conservatives regarded society as diverse and complex. To suit that vision of society, conservatives desired a more complicated government with a separation of powers, so that two co-equal houses of the legislature, an independent judiciary, and a powerful governor could jealously watch, check, and balance each other. Where democrats concentrated electoral power to fulfill the public will, conservatives sought to limit and complicate the majority’s clout. Distrusting human nature, they regarded inaction (or “gridlock” as we would put it today), as preferable to the hyperactive legislation of popular government./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Charged with being aristocrats, conservatives had to learn how to mask their elitism in the language of republicanism. Posing as the people’s true champions, conservatives encouraged voters to distrust their legislators as corrupt demagogues. In a stroke of political genius, conservatives packaged a separation of powers as the essence of true republicanism./
#+end_quote

- Economic crisis in the 1780s pitted Radicals against Conservatives, especially on issues regarding property and price controls. Public order started to deteriorate as riots became widespread.
- The matter has become severe enough that establishment of a constitutional monarchy was seriously considered. Washington himself at one point thought it might be necessary. Noah Webster, the lexicographer, also penned an essay expressing partiality towards the monarchy option.

#+begin_quote
  /Contrary to modern belief, the founders did not intend to create a national democracy. Instead, they designed a national republic to restrain state democracies, which they blamed for the union’s woes./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By restraining democracy in the states, nationalists hoped to save republican government from a descent into anarchy or a switch to monarchy. They wanted also to preserve the union from splitting into several smaller confederacies, or many individual states, which would contest boundaries and  differences with bloody wars./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Federalists asserted an American people as an act of faith, hoping thereby to generate a self-fulfilling prophecy for the future. An American national identity emerged later, slowly, painfully, and partially. It would follow from that constitution rather than lie behind its creation./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /While claiming to seek the popular will, Federalists tried to limit the ratifying conventions to either approving or rejecting the constitution as a whole, rather than endorse only parts or make ratification contingent upon amendments. By restricting the choice in this way, Federalists maximized their greatest advantage: that they offered an alternative to the ineffectual and unpopular Articles of Confederation. Rather than defend the Articles, most Anti-Federalists proposed sweeping amendments meant to weaken the Federal Constitution./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Many Americans today celebrate the Federal Constitution as perfectly designed to promote democracy, prosperity, and power: as setting the United States on the road to greatness. In 1789, few Americans were so sure, for they worried that sectional and partisan divisions would tear apart a union that seemed too vast and diverse to last./
#+end_quote

- George Washington took his oath as first President of the United States of America on 30 April 1789, in the temporary capital city of New York.
- The new presidency was wrapped in almost monarchical trappings, bolstered by Washington's popularity. He conducted himself, and was presented by the government, in king-like manners. For a moment he was referred to as "His Majesty" and "His Highness".

#+begin_quote
  /During the spring and summer of 1789, Congress created executive departments to assist the president: state, war, treasury, and justice. Washington appointed their heads, with the approval of the Senate, and assembled them as a cabinet to consider major issues. In a pivotal development, Washington secured the power to dismiss executive officials without the Senate’s approval. Thereby the president obtained control over his administration, averting dependence on majority support in the Senate./
#+end_quote

- Alexander Hamilton, as secretary of treasury, proposed major financial reforms, including creation of a central bank, and transfer of state debts to the federal government who will henceforth assume responsibility for them.
- To pass the reforms in Congress, the government agreed on a compromise with Southern lawmakers: the capital will be moved to a spot closer to the south, in Philadelphia.
- The move to Philadelphia is also meant to be temporary; by that point, there were already plans of building a new and grand capital city along Potomac River. The government finally moved in 1800, to the city named after their president.

#+begin_quote
  /During the mid-1790s, Federalist policies produced peace, prosperity, and popularity. In the West, the Federalists secured favorable treaties with Spain, the western Indians, and the British Empire. Recovering impressively from the depression of the 1780s, the nation’s economy boomed after 1792. Hamilton’s financial program stabilized the currency and restored investor confidence. The federal assumption of state debts enabled the states to cut their taxes in half. Neutrality in the European war rewarded American shippers with enhanced trade. Merchants paid higher wages, had more ships built, and erected grander homes./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Federalists and Republicans clashed over the degree of democracy needed to sustain republican government. Federalists insisted that stability required government by an elite secure in the public esteem. Common people should deferentially elect men of superior education, wealth, and status, and those elected officials should enjoy immunity from “licentious” criticism./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Federalists insisted that the revolution was over and had been a limited struggle for independence, but Republicans countered that the revolution remained incomplete and required the democratic transformation of American society. Attacking the genteel vestiges of colonial hierarchy, Republicans promised to create a liberal society in which an impartial government would secure equal opportunities for common men by refusing any superior privileges for elites. Republicans claimed that equal rights would reward the industrious poor rather than perpetuate the idle rich. Without the allegedly artificial distortions of an elitist government, society would naturally and properly promote equality./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /As the French invaded and conquered their Dutch, Swiss, and Italian neighbors, Federalists soured on the new revolution. Already wary of democracy, Federalists came to see in France the anarchic consequences of unchecked popular power. Rejecting the earlier linkage between the two revolutions, Federalists recast the American Revolution as supposedly decorous, orderly, dignified, and solemn—and, therefore, as a complete contrast to the chaotic French version. Federalists began celebrating Britain as the champion of rational liberty, a reassuring bastion of stable government, and the source of profitable commerce./
#+end_quote

- As president, Thomas Jefferson worked to further decentralize the government, and ended the use of quasi-regal trappings for the president.

#+begin_quote
  /Jefferson promoted an “Empire of Liberty,” which favored white men at the expense of Indians and blacks. Rather than restrain westward expansion, as the British Empire and Federalists had tried (and failed) to do, Jeffersonians helped settlers dispossess Indians. A democratic but racially defined society would expand relentlessly westward, creating thousands of new farms to sustain relative equality among white men. Jeffersonians recognized that the strength of a diffuse nation lay in helping, rather than hindering, ambitious settlers./
#+end_quote

- Despite the Federalist party never having returned to power after 1800, their legacy and philosophy stayed on with Chief Justice John Marshall, who held the position for over three decades.

#+begin_quote
  /Any political victory is temporary. Like a kaleidoscope, we continue in every generation to make new combinations of clashing principles derived from the enduring importance and incompleteness of our revolution. The revolution remains embedded as selective memory in every contemporary debate./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By promising equal rights in an unequal society, the revolution opened social hierarchies to criticism and potential reform./
#+end_quote

- With no titled nobility and aristocracy, the rich property owners and merchants of the United States became the ruling class.
- For the first few decades of the United States' existence, it was much cheaper to pirate British books than pay royalties to American writers and publishers.

#+begin_quote
  /The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution barred the federal government from creating a church establishment, but that ban did not apply to the states—which became political battlegrounds between religious conservatives and their evangelical critics. Conservatives argued that a republic could not survive without the virtuous and moral citizens promoted by state-mandated financial support for religion./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Religious politics made for strange bedfellows as evangelicals allied with secularists to seek disestablishment. Most leading Patriots felt drawn to the anticlerical ideas of the European Enlightenment, but they valued the public morality promoted by churches./

  /The republic’s leaders sought to sustain a broad practice of religion without favoring any one denomination with an establishment. Indeed, they insisted that religion would prosper if all denominations could freely compete for believers./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Patriots drew a sharp line between public manhood and female domesticity. Republicanism emphasized the masculinity of the citizen, imagined as willing and able to bear arms in defense of his liberty and the common good. “Effeminate” was the worst insult that a Patriot could hurl at a rival or enemy. This republican formula treated women’s active participation in the revolution as valuable but ephemeral—and unnatural in peacetime./
#+end_quote

- Many Patriot leaders appealed to equality and liberty, while also brushing aside the issue of slavery. Many who spoke of opposition to slavery were themselves slave owners.
- Free Blacks were treated lowly, and were forced to settle together in poorly developed areas.
- Individualism became the hallmark of American society, and the country's continued economic growth and stability beyond 1790 was celebrated as proof of the power of individual freedom.

#+begin_quote
  /Historians debate how revolutionary the revolution was in its consequences. Some find little substantive change and focus on continuities from the colonial era. Other scholars emphasize expanding economic opportunities and increased political participation by common white men as radical consequences of the revolution. Both views convey only part of the story. The revolution intensified trends already underway, including political assertion by common men, territorial expansion at native expense, and the westward spread of slavery. Acceleration and intensification combined continuity with change./

* AN ESSAY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE
** /St. John Henry Newman/

#+begin_quote
  /History is not a creed or a catechism; it gives lessons rather than rules; it does not bring out clearly upon the canvass the details which were familiar to the ten thousand minds of whose combined movements and fortunes it treats./
#+end_quote

- An important note for this book: I read this years ago, with a copy I got from Kindle store. Now in 2025, I am revisiting it with an ebook copy from a different source.
- Newman's work has received modifications throughout its multiple editions. This is relevant here because the first copy I read is the second edition, and my current copy is the sixth edition.
- The often-quoted passage from this book, especially among the Catholic audience is:

#+begin_quote
  /To be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant./
#+end_quote

- This quote is from the sixth edition I'm currently reading. My first copy /did not/ have this passage.
- As I am now revisiting the book using the sixth edition, this is where my quotes will be lifted from. Except one: the very first quote in this book entry. That one is from the second edition, and I intend to keep that version here.



* AVIGNON AND ITS PAPACY
** /Joelle Rollo - Koster/

- Avignon Papacy has very detailed records of its daily affairs.
- Author believes Clement V has been much maligned, and is a much better pope than usually portrayed.
- Pope John XXII was the first pope to emphasize the connection between heresies and demonic influence.
- Franciscan poverty crisis: should Franciscans allow communal possession of goods, or completely reject it and live in absolute poverty?
- Even before Pope John XXII's rule, the arrangement is that the papacy has nominal possession of the franciscans' properties. The order is largely okay with this, but a faction called the Spirituals insisted on absolute poverty, clashing with the pope and the inquisition on the matter.
- Pope John XXII ruled that obedience to the papacy is paramount, and reiterated that the order is not obligated to live in total poverty, but the goods and properties that they can peruse will be under ownership of the papacy.
- Pope Clement VI has become the symbol of Avignon papacy's worldliness and ostentatiousness. The author does concede that Clement VI never lived a humble life like his predecessors, even quipping that he knew better how to be pope than the ones before him. But of course there's still elements of exaggeration in this.
- The conclave that elected Pope Innocent VI tried to impose greater powers for the College of Cardinals, in expense of the pope's own powers. During his own papacy, Innocent VI repudiated this maneuver, but it will come back again later during the Great Western Schism.
- In the wake of the Hundred Years' War, France was left destitute and overrun by mercenaries. These forces posed significant threat to Avignon papacy, and the Chuch had to forge alliances as well as bribe the mercenaries to keep the city safe.
- Pope Urban V highly supported and encouraged intellectual pursuit for his subjects. He was also fastidious, and personally read and notated thousands of documents.
- Urban V returned to Rome, but to maintain a stable administration, kept the Curia divided between Avignon and Rome. He later returned to Avignon, explaining that pacification of Italy and continued chaos in France meant that he is more needed in Avignon. He died in Avignon months after his return.

  /Gregory did not halve the government of the Church as Urban V had done; he left it in place in Avignon, waiting to transfer the curia whole once he was safely settled in Rome. Gregory's decision demonstrates that he understood his place in the symbolic web of the papacy and the expectations attached to his person. Italians wanted to see the father of the Catholic Church, not the French curial bureaucratic machine behind him./
#+end_quote

- Gregory XI succeeded in returning the papacy to Rome, but at the cost of inciting violent reaction from his enemies within the city.
- Towards the final days of his life, Gregory XI drafted a new regulation amending conclave rules in dire situations, allowing the voting to start within the 9-day mourning period, and foregoing the two-thirds majority vote. These rules, however, were never enacted.

#+begin_quote
  /The Avignon papacy transformed the administration of the Church by developing archives and recording procedures. This once more demonstrates the efficiency of its leadership. Registrars copied all letters in ledgers. Those made out of paper remained in Avignon until 1784, when they were shipped to Rome; they are commonly named the Avignon registers. Others were recopied on parchment. They were labeled "Vatican registers" and sent to Rome in the 1430s./

  /Cardinals and other curialists showed a remarkable detachment toward Avignon and its people, an attitude perhaps revealing their sense of the unnatural and transitory character of the Avignon papacy./
#+end_quote

- More than the popes, the cardinals were the prime examples of the extravagance and excesses of the Avignon papacy. The popes themselves admonished cardinals who flaunted ostentatious lifestyle, but the cardinals mostly just ignored the criticisms.

  /The struggle for power among religious and secular authorities shaped life and politics in western Europe in the Early Middle Ages.

#+begin_quote
  /Cemeteries in medieval Avignon were well integrated into the fabric of urban life. Traditionally, urban cemeteries were open spaces, and as population grew, so did the demand for their space. Medieval cemeteries hosted many economic and social activities, an uncomfortable thought for our modern Western society, so sheltered from the sight of death./

  /One of the lessons the Schism offers institutional historians is that two papal capitals could compete in advancing the legitimacy of their respective claimants and both be successful. Two papal courts could not only survive but flourish. If Rome and Avignon had not been thriving Christian cities, they would not have rivaled each other for papal supremacy for close to two generations without instigating major social upheavals. The Church's administration had been so well defined by the Avignon popes and was so innovative and efficient that it could be cut in half and still function quite effectively./
#+end_quote

- Author seems to take the view that the schism didn't significantly affect religiosity for most Christians. Otherwise, there would've been greater chaos and impetus to resolve the split.
- The book treats both sides of the Schism fairly. Each is not any more right or wrong in claiming Petrine authority, and both struggled to deal with their religious and political circumstances.
- A main reason for the Schism's longevity is the support external parties provided for each side. Especially in the Avignon side, their pope enjoyed financial support from both internal and external sources.
- The author briefly mentions that the Schism promoted the concept of conciliarism, and described it as "dangerous", without elaborating much on it.
- One of the lasting legacies of Avignon papacy is its massive support for education, including benefices for many students.

#+begin_quote
  /The Avignon popes were certainly no more venal nor less worthy to claim the papal office than their predecessors and successors. As southwestern Frenchmen, their mental apparatus and reflexes were not that different from their contemporaries; venality and nepotism were rampant among all members of the high society. The popes simply acted like men of their times./

* CATACLYSM
** /David Stevenson/

#+begin_quote
  /The First World War took on characteristics that made it emblematic of other modern wars, extending through the twentieth century and beyond. It visited horrific new experiences on the combatants and forced unprecedented mobilization on their home fronts. As well as being a disaster in its own right it became the precondition for further disasters, including the Second World War, whose casualties numbered millions more. It compelled the creation of new social coping mechanisms in the face of mass death, mutilation, and bereavement, and yet in many regions of the world its legacies fuel bloodshed to this day. Finally, it was a cataclysm of a special kind, a man-made catastrophe produced by political acts, and as such can still a century later both raise powerful emotions and prompt disturbing questions as a portent. Its victims died neither from an unseen virus nor from mechanical failure and individual fallibility. They owed their fate to deliberate state policy, decided on by governments that repeatedly rejected alternatives to violence and commanded not merely acquiescence but also active support from millions of their peoples. Contemporaries on both sides at once hated the slaughter and yet felt unable to disengage from it, embroiled in a tragedy in the classical sense of a conflict between right and right./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /I have sought to represent it as a totality, and therefore emphasized the underlying processes and decisions that equipped millions of men with devastating firepower, set them in mortal combat against each other, and held them in the most appalling conditions for year after year./
#+end_quote

- I would personally assess this book as being top-heavy, that is, much emphasis is placed on the political aspects. But this isn't contradictory to the author's goal. It's actually fundamentally the same: he laid out the "underlying processes and decisions" which are, indeed, the ones that the political and military leaders are responsible for.

#+begin_quote
  /The conventions and rituals of warfare were familiar parts of Europe’s life, and the memory of previous conflicts integral to its culture. Until the eighteenth century it had known few years in which none of its great powers were engaged in fighting. Only since then had the modern pattern emerged of  decades of peace punctuated by successively more total wars. Peace – even in the simple sense of the absence of killing – was a modern phenomenon, and Europe had never known anything comparable to the great peace that ended in 1914./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Although in summer 1914 international tension was acute, a general war was not inevitable and if one had not broken out then it might not have done so at all. It was the Habsburg monarchy’s response to Sarajevo that caused a crisis./
#+end_quote

- The author thinks that while Austria-Hungary's response to the ultimatum was what caused the war, their grievances towards Serbia were not wholly unjustified, and has some strong reasons to be suspicious of the kingdom.
- On the eve of the War, both Germans and Magyars combined accounted for less than half of Austria-Hungary's population.
- While there was a general sense that Austria-Hungary needs internal reform, prior to the War the empire is fairly stable and united, and that it has certainly weathered more desperate times than 1914.
- Germany may be to blame for starting the war, but it wasn't a premeditated policy either. Germany in 1914 may be ruled by the unstable Wilhelm II, but in general the empire isn't a political outlier or pariah, and isn't aggressively hostile to other European powers.

#+begin_quote
  /In the decade from 1897 to 1908 Wilhelm intervened frequently in policy-making and he always exerted considerable influence over diplomacy and in military and naval matters. Yet this influence was erratic. Wilhelm was intelligent and open-minded but was also a restless and neurotic poseur who spent much of his reign sailing and hunting, and his officials found ways to work round him. All the same, he was Germany’s public face. Although at times of crisis he mostly showed caution, he created the impression that his government was aggressive and militaristic (which normally it was not) and capricious and unpredictable (which it certainly was). His presence for more than a quarter of a century on the throne of such a powerful country grievously undermined European stability./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By 1914 the crises, the arms race, and Berlin’s encirclement phobia had taken on a mutually reinforcing momentum. Both blocs were consolidating and were more likely to hold firm in the next test: Russia and France had rearmed sufficiently to proceed more boldly while Germany and Austria-Hungary foresaw the balance tipping further against them. The recurrent confrontations impelled statesmen to consider fighting as an alternative to endless scares and threats./
#+end_quote

- Russia did not actively support Serbia in its conflicts in the years prior to 1914, e.g. in the Balkan Wars. However, Russia deemed it necessary to intervene in 1914 because their influence in the Balkans could deteriorate if Austria-Hungary gets their way. Russia also deemed that it's ready for such a war, despite their ongoing rearmament plans not having met its goal yet.
- Instead of waiting for Serbia's response to the ultimatum, Russia immediately went on pre-mobilization process. This arguably forced other country's hands, as Austria-Hungary also immediately mobilized on the day the ultimatum was rejected, on 28 July.

#+begin_quote
  /Across the continent the feeling in the countryside and in small towns – where most units would come from and where most Europeans still lived – was more apprehensive and depressed than in the capital cities. Among intellectuals, although many were exhilarated by manifestations of national unity and welcomed the war as an opportunity for cleansing and regeneration, others viewed it with horror and disgust as a scarcely credible reversion to the primitive. These reactions failed to translate themselves, however, into effective resistance./

  /Whatever the foreboding with which Europeans went to war, little force was needed to make them go. The mass conscription and reservist training systems developed over a generation had taught those mobilized what to do, and the spread of literacy, a national press, and festivals such as Bastille Day in France and Sedan Day in Germany had strengthened the sense of national community./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /For war to happen governments on both sides had to declare it and to set their military machines in motion. The European peace might have been a house of cards, but someone still had to topple it. It used to be argued that 1914 was a classic instance of a war begun through accident and error: that no statesmen wanted it but all were overborne by events. This view is now untenable./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Once two heavily armed and highly industrialized coalitions comparable strength engaged each other with modern military technology the outcome, almost at once, would be a prodigiously costly stalemate that propelled the European governments and their hapless peoples into a bleak and cruel new world./

#+begin_quote
  /In this middle period of the war, between late 1914 and the next major turning point in spring 1917, the powers created a style of combat that in retrospect seemed to encapsulate the conflict as a whole. Its key features were escalation and stalemate, both sides applying rising levels of violence yet failing to terminate the impasse. The war became more nearly total and more global, and from these characteristics much of its enduring impact followed. Yet the seeming equilibrium was not static but dynamic, the initiative passing back and forth as each side strove to pre-empt or thwart the other’s gambits and attempted new expedients to catch its adversary off balance./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The ‘short-war illusion’ that had helped to cause the conflict did not end in 1914. On the contrary, both soldiers and civilians, deprived of the luxury of hindsight, were sustained in part by faith that one more determined heave would bring triumph./
#+end_quote

- Though the battlefield itself was in a state of attrition from end-1914 to early-1918, in reality the war kept escalating to dangerous new levels.
- The parity of strength between the two sides caused the attrition, and also caused them to further escalate, developing new lethal war tools and methods such as tanks and chemical weapons, and opening up new fronts all over the world in hopes of breaking the deadlock.

#+begin_quote
  /In Britain at the time, if not simply called ‘the war’, the conflict was referred to as ‘the great war’, evoking the earlier struggle against Napoleon; in France ‘la guerre’ or ‘la grande guerre’ was the usual description. ‘World war’ and ‘guerre mondiale’ became prevalent only from the 1930s. In Germany, in contrast, ‘Weltkrieg’ was the preferred description from the start, the Berlin leaders understanding that they were fighting for world-power status and that their enemies were concentrating the resources of their empires against them. Americans too referred to the conflict generally as ‘the world war’ (rather than ‘ European war’) after being drawn in, and by 1917 almost all the biggest and strongest countries across the globe had indeed become belligerents./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /As in the July crisis pre-existing alliances influenced decisions for war much less than did considerations of national interest. But unlike in 1914 the later entrants had time to define their requirements and to negotiate with the two sides. Although this more leisured timetable should have permitted ngreater public debate, in fact most of the interventions were driven through by authoritarian governments not only to advance their external interests but also to outmanoeuvre rivals at home./
#+end_quote

- Japan's entry to the war is fueled by both desire to dominate China and to gain international recognition as equals with the Western Powers. They had little to lose for joining, and more to gain especially if their side wins. Finally, Japan is uniquely distant from the main theaters of war, so they are relatively insulated from its worse effects while enjoying the advantage of expanding their sphere of influence with minimal European intervention.
- Armenians were conscripted by both Russian and Ottoman Armies to their side. The Ottoman government did not like that Armenians in Russian territory refused to rebel against Russia. The policy of retribution and eventually genocide spread throughout 1915, and Ottomans justified it as reponse against rebellion and disloyalty.
- Incompatibility and scale of each side's war aims is not enough to explain the failure of diplomacy in ending the War. The war aims of the First World War were much more modest than those of the Second World War.

#+begin_quote
  /War aims were necessarily hypothetical and transitory sets of options. Few entailed unconditional commitments. The peace terms governments envisaged varied with their military and diplomatic prospects, as well as with their appraisal of domestic opinion. Ultimately their objectives were products of the fear and insecurity that had haunted the great powers before the July crisis and that developments since had intensified, though they were also characteristic expressions of European nationalism and imperialism./
#+end_quote

- The stalemate persisted because the Allies refused to make separate peace, while also having their own war aims that they expect would be realized only through victory and postwar settlement.

#+begin_quote
  /If war aims determined what the fighting was for, strategy decided where and when it happened. Yet governments oversaw the commanders’ key decisions, and the basic strategic choices made in the war were as much political as technical. Moreover (and this is often overlooked), the two sides’ strategies interacted, each reflecting an appraisal of the other’s intentions. Both the Allies and the Central Powers committed themselves to mounting levels of violence, culminating in the massive Western and Eastern Front battles of 1916. And when these battles failed to bring decisive results, both approached strategic bankruptcy. Once again the underlying themes here are therefore stalemate and escalation./
#+end_quote

- Romania's entry into the War on Allies' side ultimately forced the Kaiser to accept the Hindenburg-Ludendorff command of German military.

#+begin_quote
  /The Allied military chiefs concluded from their 1916 experiences that they should try more of the same./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /An impasse at the level of tactics drove the two sides towards more ruthless strategies: the Allies towards escalating doses of attrition and the Germans towards Verdun and unrestricted submarine warfare. But this was not a static equilibrium, and both attackers and defenders were increasing their tactical sophistication and the number and power of the weapons at their disposal. Developments were in progress that after 1917 would break the stalemate./
#+end_quote

- Although it can be argued that the Allies would've used lethal gases anyway, it was Germany that initiated its use, and therefore were the unfortunate ones to be leveld with war crime charges for it.
- Aerial warfare was still in its infancy in the First World War, and hardly helped either side. The British enjoyed massive air superiority in Somme, but it proved barely useful for them.
- However, aircrafts proved more useful for mapping and surveillance. Aerial mapping was instrumental in producing more accurate battlefield maps, which translated to more accurate artillery firing.

#+begin_quote
  /Despite the vastly different operational circumstances outside Europe, Western Front tactical conditions still tended to develop wherever modern weapons and high force-to-space ratios coexisted./

  /Although no continental power had expected so long and punishing an ordeal, their conscription systems meant that they had mostly registered their able-bodied men in peacetime and possessed the machinery to call them up, and also that many men had had military training. Even so, after the first year it proved harder to find trained officers and soldiers than to produce weapons./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Given the extraordinary casualty rates that the war inflicted from its opening weeks, it may seem strange that the manpower crisis that all the belligerents suffered by 1917 did not set in much earlier. Enough men were found not only to keep the fighting going but also to intensify it in the battles of 1916. One reason, paradoxical as it may seem, was trench warfare./

  /Admittedly, the argument is double-edged: without trenches the two sides could not have remained in such constant close proximity, especially as they were armed, as the war went on, with an increasingly powerful array of weapons. Trenches, and innovations such as railway supply lines and tinned food, enabled the killing to continue throughout the year instead of the armies retiring in the traditional manner to winter quarters./

  /Digging in reduced casualties between battles and slowed down the rate of attrition. Whether it saved lives over the war as a whole is debatable./
#+end_quote

- It was only in the recent decades that individual soldier experiences, told through diaries and memoirs, received more spotlight in the study of First World War history.

#+begin_quote
  /Post-traumatic stress disorder, to give its modern name to the condition labelled ‘shell shock’ in the English-speaking countries, had doubtless existed in earlier conflicts, but had not been diagnosed as such. It was exacerbated by the special conditions of static warfare in which soldiers endured repeated bombardments in confined spaces with little control over their fate, and lived day after day in close proximity to their comrades’ decomposing remains./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In the vast decentralized confusion of a major offensive, in which tens of thousands of men might be engaged along fronts of many miles, the personal control still possible in Napoleon’s day was no longer attainable. Such ‘battles’ had little in common with Waterloo except the term itself./

  /Governments and high commands created the circumstances in which thousands of troops with merciless weaponry were obliged to kill and maim, but they could not determine the speed and scale of carnage./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
 /War was expensive. Every one of the millions of bullets and shells fired off had a price tag. Every soldier had to be paid (however miserably), clothed and fed, transported to and from the front and cared for if wounded or ill. His equipment had to be manufactured and tested, and then transported by trains that needed fuel and maintenance and by animals requiring fodder and stabling. The soldiers’ families were allocated separation allowances, and the disabled, widows, and orphans needed sustenance, as did thousands of refugees./

  /Legislatures and finance ministries relaxed their oversight on military spending, initially expecting a short war, and failed to regain control when it proved to be long. In the colossal Western Front bombardments the fruits of years of patient capital accumulation went literally up in smoke./

  /European treasuries were caught between untrammelled military outgoings and the political imperative of not reviving peacetime controversies through tax increases. They tried – and here again the ‘short-war illusion’ was evident – to cover their deficits by borrowing at home and abroad, and beyond that in effect by ‘printing money’ if they received central bank credits without collateral. No central bank preserved much independence in wartime conditions: even the Bank of England, supposedly a private corporation, yielded to the Treasury its influence over interest rates and sterling’s exchange value./
#+end_quote

- Belligerent countries abandoned the gold standard during the War so they can print virtually unlimited paper money to fund their War effort.

#+begin_quote
  /The investing public in Germany and Britain wagered on victory in a desperate and evenly matched conflict. To be sure, there were few alternative financial outlets and governments offered attractive incentives, at the cost of mounting debt service and an albatross round the necks of post-war taxpayers. But the willingness to lend also testified to an innocence derived from pre-war monetary stability as well as to a residuum of patriotism. War finance depended on traditional values and assumptions that  the conflict itself was subverting./
#+end_quote

- Beyond 1915, the First World War at sea was also in stalemate, but mainly due to inactivity. Both sides were hesitant to engage the enemy at full power and in the open seas. Much of naval conflict in this period are related to enforcement and breaking of blockades.
- Despite the attrition, the Allies — especially Britain — have clear advantage and dominance in much of the world's seas and oceans.

#+begin_quote
  /The First World War cannot be understood without acknowledging the widespread and continuing acceptance that it was a just, even noble cause. Every belligerent relied on a combination of state compulsion with patriotic support from society, even if the former was relatively more important in the eastern European countries and the latter in the western European ones. Between them these forces not only created an initial political truce in 1914 but also maintained domestic cohesion when the conflict intensified, with a corresponding increase in its demands./
#+end_quote

- Officially, the Catholic Church under Pope Benedict XV maintained a neutral stance on the War. Realistically, many Catholics, including clergy, in all belligerent states supported their country's cause.
- Censorship was widely employed by belligerent governments, both to suppress criticism and to hide the extent of losses.

#+begin_quote
  /For the Irish, for women’s leaders, and for trade unionists the political truce of 1914 was a temporary measure, accepted without prejudice to their ultimate objectives. Once the war settled down to a stalemate, their loyalty might be expected to falter./

- The defection of Petrograd garrison in the February Revolution was a response to what the soldiers think was an unreasonable order. They have been dealing with the protesters peaccefully for days, until Tsar Nicholas II ordered them to use force to break up the protests. The soldiers, who have already developed sympathies with the striking workers, refused to follow the orders, so they defected instead.

  /The removal of the dynasty, intended to help contain the revolution, probably did more than anything else to convince the peasantry that they could challenge the social order with impunity.

- The author thinks that, without the unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmerman incident, the US wouldn't have joined the War, and it could've ended with more favorable terms — even if they lost — for the Central Powers.

#+begin_quote
  /While both Bethmann and Wilson might have preferred to keep America neutral, their priorities were fundamentally in conflict. Bethmann intended to confine Washington’s role to bringing the two sides to the conference table, after which America should withdraw while Germany imposed its demands and return only to help set up international institutions that would guarantee the new status quo. Wilson, however, was willing to join a League of Nations only if the peace settlement respected liberal principles. The German leaders were right to suspect he would be biased against them. The escape route of an American-mediated compromise occupied a great deal of attention in Berlin and Washington but was never likely to get anywhere./
#+end_quote

- The primary effect of the Zimmerman incident was in uniting the American public in support of intervention. Wilson himself didn't want it, but ultimately gave in to counsel from his advisers and cabinet, who were unanimously in favor of joining the War.
- Still, Wilson wasn't entirely pressured by the public, and he could've at least opposed intervention and face a divided Congress. And the author thinks such a divided Congress likely wouldn't have approved of intervention had Wilson come out to oppose it too.

#+begin_quote
  /The year 1917 saw the end of the short-war illusion. Even after military deadlock had set in, the hope that one more heave might yet bring victory had lured both sides on. But unrestricted submarine warfare failed to break the British, and the February Revolution wrecked Allied plans for a new round of synchronized offensives. American power would need at least a year to take full effect, and in the meantime Allied co-operation withered. Weapons output peaked, armies diminished, home-front consensus and troop morale faltered, both sides explored less costly strategies, and both moderated their war aims./
#+end_quote

- Though the convoy system adopted in 1917 was crucial in reducing shipping losses, it was not the sole factor that helped the Allies. While designed to deter U-boat attacks on merchant ships, the U-boats themselves were dealt with by sea mines, coupled with slower rate of production.
- Petain's solution to the 1917 mutinies was a combination of accomodation to some of the soldiers' grievances, and punishment for some mutiny leaders as form of deterrence. Overall his strategy was successful, and the issue gradually died down within the year.
- I'm only lightly touching this section for the year 1917, because the author also has a book specifically for that year of the War. I've read it before, I'll just revisit it some other time.

#+begin_quote
  /A Russian civil war was always likely after the Bolshevik Revolution, given Lenin’s incomplete control of the country and his contempt for his opponents. The Czech revolt both made it possible for the Allies to intervene and gave them a motive, as well as escalating the civil war to a bigger and more savage stage./
#+end_quote

- As the War entered its last year, the conflict increasingly became more ideological.
- Support for Wilson's Fourteen Points meant that the Allies encouraged the many nationalities within Habsburg Empire to push for sovereignty. Though not directly intended, the breakup of the Habsburg monarchy became the final consequence of the Allies' policies.

#+begin_quote
  /Like the decisions to start the war, those to stop it should be analysed as being in the first instance due to rational appraisal, despite there being evidence that both sides miscalculated./
#+end_quote

- When Ludendorff and Hindenburg initiated armistice talks, they wrongly assumed that the cessation of hostilities would give them time to prepare for a future resumption of the conflict. They also thought that Wilson's Fourteen Points are vague enough to be skirted around. Finally, they miscalculated the effect an armistice would have on their remaining allies, especially Austria-Hungary.
- The US wanted to end the War soon as a prolonged conflict could severely damage their economy and the people's morale. Britain and France wanted also an earlier end of hostilities, but mainly because a prolonged War would allow the US to further dominate the Entente alliance, to the European Powers' detriment.

  /The Dual Monarchy was destroyed, as its leaders had long dreaded, by a combination of nationalist uprisings with pressure from outside.

- By late 1918, the Austro-Hungarian army was so battered that it had practically no capability of suppressing internal revolts even if Vienna wanted to.

#+begin_quote
  /Whereas the Austro-Hungarian revolutions had been led by pre-formed national committees, the German uprising surprised even the left-wing parties, resembling Russia’s February Revolution rather than that of October. It originated from a mutiny in the fleet, provoked by secret plans for a naval offensive, or Flottenvorstoss, against Britain. Once more a misjudged military initiative made Germany’s situation worse than if no action had been taken, and this time the damage was fatal./

  /The pandemic was overshadowed by the war at the time as it has been since, perhaps because it was a natural calamity rather than a man-made one, perhaps because most of the dead were not in the west, and perhaps because the world had grown callous.

  /Lasting peace (or at least the absence of hostilities) was made possible for the North Atlantic area by the sacrifices of 1914–18, and to this extent there was genuine reason to celebrate in that grey November. The western world was not foredoomed to follow the disastrous trajectory that it pursued in the succeeding decades. Yet the very cost of victory, by undermining political and social stability, had stacked the odds against a peaceful future. No account of the impact and significance of the conflict can be complete without an assessment of its aftermath and its poisoned legacy./

  /The First World War was the greatest event of its time, not only for what happened during it but also for its subsequent impact. Its global repercussions extended down to 1945, and arguably to the collapse of Soviet Communism and the end of the Cold War, not to say beyond. It has become customary to see it as the opening of an age of catastrophe, or as the beginning of a ‘short twentieth century’ that lasted until 1989, after which (and especially after 11 September 2001) the world entered a different era./

  /As the years have passed – and particularly since a second and even greater world war – that of 1914–18 has become a less dominating imaginative and political landmark. As the ripples from its impact have widened, their strength has diminished.

- The terms of the Treaty of Versailles were written to be simply drafts meant for later renegotiations. Instead, the parties opted to adopt them as the definitive conditions.

#+begin_quote
  /It became clear almost at once that the Germans would not voluntarily comply with the settlement, and that the Allies faced the prospect of continuing vigilance and confrontation at a time when most of their demobilized soldiers desperately wanted to return to normality and to their private lives. All the same, during the 1920s, although the post-war world was a turbulent place, at least there was little risk of another major armed conflict. By the 1930s even this was no longer true, and hopes that the sacrifices of 1914–18 could ‘end war’ – that they could eliminate the international insecurity that had caused the calamity – were cruelly disappointed. It was probably for this reason more than any other that many not only in the defeated countries but even in the victorious ones came to see the entire enterprise as having been futile, and this perception both modified the way in which the war was remembered and influenced Western politicians in favour of appeasement./
#+end_quote

- Author argues that the main reason the postwar settlement collapsed is because of disunity.
- Japan wanted to be recognized as equals with the Western Powers in the Treaty, even if just by general principle. The recommendation was actually approved by majority, but Wilson ultimately ruled that it cannot be accepted.
- The more central concern for Japan was the issue of Shandong in China. The Japanese wanted to keep it, and convinced the Allies that they will negotiate its return to China in the future. Wilson dissented, but wanting to keep Tokyo in the conference, he ultimately acquiesced.

  /Although the Allies agreed to hold their Arab territories as League of Nations ‘A’ mandates, which were supposed to be allocated in accordance with the population’s wishes, the report of the King–Crane Commission (composed of two Americans who sounded out local opinion) was disregarded. King and Crane advised that Syria should become a constitutional monarchy under Sharif Hussein’s son Faisal, with the United States or Britain as the mandatory power; and that Arab opinion opposed Jewish immigration into Palestine. Yet Syria ended up under French rule, and over the next two decades the number of Jews in Palestine multiplied by a factor of nine./

  /The Germans struck a chord with many in Britain and America when they charged that the Versailles treaty was a hypocritical Diktat: a dictated peace, imposed by threat of force, violating the armistice agreement, and applying Wilson’s principles one-sidedly. Germany was disarmed, but the Allies were not (although they promised to consider disarmament). Germany lost its colonies, but the Allies kept theirs, and added former German and Ottoman possessions. Self-determination was applied where it would damage Germany, but ignored where it might not. Versailles considerably exceeded a strict reading of the Fourteen Points (for example in the Saar and Rhineland and over war pensions), and the Allies gave Germany little if any credit for the removal of Wilhelm II’s autocracy./

  /The treaty could have stopped another bloodbath if it had been upheld. More difficult is the question of whether it sealed the fate of German democracy and ensured the return of a militarist regime. On the one hand, the democratization of the country was incomplete even before the treaty was signed and the elites inherited from before the German revolution had not abandoned their struggle against the Allies. On the other, however, although the treaty certainly inflamed German nationalism, it contained deliberately inserted provisions to allow for relaxation and reconciliation if Germany’s behaviour changed./

  /Although the Germans were entitled to protest against a breach of faith, the terms protected legitimate Allied economic and security needs, they did not predetermine a second round of conflict, and they left a variety of futures open./

- The author argues that WW2 isn't inevitable, and wouldn't have happened if only the Treaty was properly implemented.

#+begin_quote
  /Germany had accepted the peace treaty under nprotest and only when threatened with military action. This did not mean that the Allies had been wrong to halt the war in 1918, but it did mean that they needed to show continuing solidarity and firmness. In fact they only intermittently displayed either, and because they depended for treaty implementation on the German government’s voluntary co-operation their enforcement efforts almost immediately ran into trouble./

- Germany's inability to pay war reparations after 1921 led to France occupying the Ruhr mines in 1923. This in turn caused greater financial strain for the Weimar Republic, which ran into hyperinflation.
- In the US, hundreds of thousands of Black population resettled from the south to the north. Race-related violence spread throughout the country, with the KKK being re-restablished on a national scale. Wilson did not do enough to help out the Blacks.

  /The establishment of a pervasive cult of war commemoration had the potential to act as a conservative, patriotic, integrative force, and governments deliberately encouraged it with this intention. The phenomenon of ‘remembrance’ was one of the most striking novelties of the decade, and it carried a special emotional charge because of the conflict’s human balance sheet./

- The large amount of casualties left by the War necessitated a new form of welfare, one aimed at caring for the War veterans.
- Radical left-wing movements arose immediately following the War, but beaten back by right-wing counteroffensives by early 1920s. In general, moderates partial to the status quo dominated the 1920s. However, right-wing politics also gradually became more intensified.
- European economic growth was much slower in the interwar period than either before WW1 or after WW2. Part of this is because of surplus productions and financial volatility.
- Despite the signs of economic recovery in the late 1920s, in general the economic issues caused by the war weren't resolved and were merely slightly alleviated.
- When the Great Depression arrived in Europe, it hit the continent very hard. This was further compounded by the countries' refusal to cooperate with each other due to lingering postwar animosity.

  /The war was essential to the Nazi takeover not only through its contribution to the economic crisis but also through its role in reawakening German nationalism as the memory of 1914–18 was re-evaluated./

- Pacifism became more widepread in Britain and its territories, fueled by disillusionment from the War. Economic hardships also contributed to unwillingness to assert the terms of Versailles, and made appeasement an attractive policy until 1938.
- As the 1920s progressed, American opinion of the War veered towards disillusionment and abhorrence. The conflict was seen as unnecessary, and isolationism as foreign policy gained traction. It even became commonplace to blame bankers and arms manufacturers for the US entry into the War.
- The retreat of Britain and the United States also affected France's disposition, which tried to forestall conflict by being lenient on the enforcement of Versailles treaty.
- All these combined precisely at the time when Hitler was rising, thus they were unable to stop him in gaining full control of Germany. The prevalence of the "stab in the back" mindset also deterred opposition against Hitler, further strengthening his base.
- After the Second World War, its memory and lessons supplanted those of the First. The 1914-1918 conflict became less significant, and when drawing lessons to past conflicts, future leaders and policymakers went as far back as the interwar period but rarely delved in the First World War.

- Fritz Fischer's work on the origins and war aims of Germany fully blamed the country for initiating the First World War. The work continues to spark debates to this day.

#+begin_quote
  /Even though his first book has better withstood criticism, it overstated the unanimity within the Berlin elite and understated the resemblances between Germany’s war aims and those of the Allies. None the less, most German historians came round to its more nuanced assessment of Germany’s role in the July crisis, and (despite some important qualifications by subsequent writers) much of its analysis of the scope of German wartime ambitions has survived unchallenged./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Whereas most previous studies of the origins of the war had concentrated on the diplomatic interplay between all the powers, Fischer exploited the new archival sources to highlight the connections between foreign and domestic policy in one country. He inspired a succession of comparable studies of pre-1914 foreign policy and of war aims in the other powers. Hence during the 1970s and 1980s the diplomatic history of the war’s origins, course, and aftermath was substantially rewritten, while the intensification of the superpower arms race in the era of Euromissiles and the Strategic Defense Initiative stimulated interest among political scientists in 1914 analogies. The new research uncovered more  of pre-war contingency planning for a European conflict, but little for any premeditated decision to launch one, and it suggested that war aims in the Allied countries were more tentative, defensive, and detached from domestic conflicts than they were in Germany. None the less, all the belligerent governments paid close attention to their political objectives, and examination of the other powers reinforced Fischer’s essential insight that the killing was begun and prolonged through deliberate political will./
#+end_quote

- Author notes that while most facets of the First World War have been receiving steady attention in the recent decades, there's still much unexplored regarding its economic history.
- One good reason for recommending this book as overview for WW1 is the discussion of the War's historiography, in the conclusion section. It helps contextualize the discussions that have developed since, and also shaped this book's role as a more modern synthesis of the subject.
- Granted, this book was from 2004, so it's not the most recent available (as of 2025). There's also been so much newer works about the First World War in general during its centennial period (2014-2018). I do think it's still a really solid overview, though not the first one I would recommend to a general reader (my first recommendation would be *A World Undone* by /GJ Meyer/).
- Author notes three takeaways from the cultural turn of WW1 historiography:
  - WW1 as mark of the rise of modernism;
  - shift in language and method of remembrance through the subsequent decades;
  - greater incorporation of individual soldiers' perspectives on the War, like their experience during and after the conflict.

#+begin_quote
  /To an extent, as the inter-war revisionists argued, the war was indeed the child of fear and insecurity, born of an international system based on armed and sovereign states, in which the developing nineteenth-century forces of democratization and economic integration failed to eclipse the balance of power system. All the European powers contributed to the growth of tension in the pre-1914 decade. None the less, the fundamental contention of the Versailles ‘war-guilt’ article was justified, and the work of writers such as Albertini and Fischer has confirmed it. The rulers of Austria–Hungary and Germany did not predetermine before 1914 their decision to resort to force, but in the July–August crisis they made a decision to start a Balkan war and to accept the risk that it would escalate into a European one. Certainly both governments felt threatened, but for neither was this much of a mitigating circumstance./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Now that decades of historical research have stripped away the encrustations of hindsight and better enabled us to see the struggle as it appeared to the contemporaries who waged it, the governments seem more purposive, the armed forces more adaptive, and the ordinary soldiers and civilians more willing and informed participants than once was thought. These changes of perspective have made it easier to understand both how the massacre could happen and why it was so difficult to stop./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /It might seem easiest to adopt the absolute pacifist position – that in no circumstances can force ever be justified – were it not for the evidence that inaction may lead to even greater evils. Yet any decision for war must confront the historical evidence that it is a fearfully blunt instrument, the repercussions of whose use cannot reliably be predicted and which may make matters even worse. Intrinsic to all military undertakings, however legitimate their motives, is the risk that they will violate the principle of proportionality between ends and means, and that they too will lead to a bad war and a bad peace. The 1914–18 conflict and the settlement that followed it remain archetypes of both, and the insights to be gained from studying them have a universal applicability, if only as a distant but a forceful warning./

* CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY: A VERY SHORT INTRODUCTION
** /Simon Critchley/

#+begin_quote
  /There is a gap in much philosophy between theoretical questions of how one knows what one knows, and more practical or existential questions of what it might mean to lead a good or fulfilled human life. Much mainstream philosophy has given up the task of trying to integrate knowledge and wisdom into a single synoptic vision./
#+end_quote

- For the ancients, philosophy is a practical science, concerned with the meaning and pursuit of a good life. For non-philosophers today, philosophy is perceived as being concerned with those same questions.
- The author however argues that professional philosophy today has retreated from such concerns, leaving it to self-help and New Age gurus. To an extent, professional philosophers may even balk at the thought of their discipline as being about how to live well.
- Part of the reason for philosophy's retreat is the rise of modern science. The idea that truth has to be empirically verifiable and grounded on scientific method meant that philosophy has lost its longstanding domain, and has been relegated to thought experiments.

#+begin_quote
  /I do not think that the question of the meaning of life is reducible to empirical investigation. It is just not a causal matter. There is, I think, a gap between knowledge and wisdom: not an explanatory gap that might be closed by producing a better, more comprehensive theory, but more of a felt gap. If all epistemic worries are to be resolved empirically by scientific enquiry, then we might feel that even if – one fine and beautiful morning – all those worries were resolved, then this would somehow still be irrelevant to the question of wisdom, to the question of knowing in what exactly a good human life might consist./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /If what is mistaken in much contemporary philosophy is its infatuation with science, which leads to scientism, then the equally mistaken rejection of science leads to obscurantism./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /My contention is that what philosophy should be thinking through at present is this dilemma which on the one side threatens to turn us into beasts, and on the other side into lunatics. This means that the question of wisdom, and its related question of the meaning of life, should at the very least move closer to the centre of philosophical activity and not be treated with indifference, embarrassment, or even contempt. The appeal of much that goes under the name of Continental philosophy, in my view, is that it attempts to unify or at least move closer together questions of knowledge and wisdom, of philosophical truth and existential meaning./
#+end_quote

- Author argues that Continental Philosophy, as a philosophical tradition, began with Kant in 1781. What followed since then have been over two centuries of back-and-forth that center on Kant's philosophy.
- In his first Critique, Kant lays out the dualism of experience and reason. In the third Critique, Kant proposes Judgment as the unifier of those two.
- On one hand, a strand of Continental philosophy critiqued Kant's dualist theory. On the other hand, another strand, which evolved into German idealism, proposed a different unifier than Judgment.
  - Kant: Judgment
  - Hegel: Spirit
  - Schopenhauer: Will
  - Nietzsche: Power
  - Marx: Praxis
  - Freud: Unconscious
  - Heidegger: Being

#+begin_quote
  /The question of the status of reason and rationality versus the irrationality of much of human existence is a conflict that is at the heart of disagreements in the Continental tradition to this day, for example in the modernism/postmodernism debate that defined much of the 1980s and early 1990s./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /There is something ultimately parochial and intellectually cowardly about identifying oneself with either side of a perceived philosophical divide, because it prevents the possible intellectual challenges that would be the consequence of a dialogue outside of one’s professional entrenchments./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The influence of Continental philosophy in the English speaking world, particularly in its more recent Francophone versions, is arguably much stronger outside philosophy departments than within them, where it has decisively influenced many theoretical innovations in the humanities and social sciences: in literary theory, art history and theory, social and political theory, cultural studies, historiography, religious studies, and anthropology, not to mention debates in fine art, architecture, feminism, and psychoanalysis. Revealingly and significantly, the reception of Continental thought in the English speaking world has, for the most part, taken place outside of philosophy departments./
#+end_quote

- So funny and somehow apt that the author would take a Hegelian view on the Analytic-Continental divide: Both sides are legitimate cultures of philosophy, and it's through dialogue and friendly antagonism that the gap could be narrowed and understanding be achieved.

#+begin_quote
  /It is arguable that there is too great a propensity towards commentary to the detriment of originality in contemporary Continental philosophy in the English-speaking world. But what is lacking in such a criticism (and in Rorty’s criterion) is the recognition of a distinct practice of philosophy with a quite different sense of the importance of translation, commentary, interpretation, tradition, and history for contemporary philosophical research. It is not that philosophy in the Continental tradition is dismissive of problems – far from it – it is rather that problems are often approached textually and contextually, and therefore demand a different mode of treatment, one that might appear more indirect./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The texts of the Continental tradition make up a kind of documentary archive of philosophical problems, with a distinct relation to their context and our own and marked by a strong consciousness of history. We will use different resources in this archive at different times, depending on the nature of the problems we are confronted with and seeking to think through. But what characterizes many of the texts in this archive is that – like those of Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche – they are characterized by a strong historical self-consciousness that will not allow them to be read without reference to their context or our own./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /One might say that the gain of the Continental tradition is that it allows one to focus on the essentially historical nature of philosophy as a practice and the essentially historical nature of the philosopher who engages in this practice. This is the insight into what is usually called ‘historicity’./
#+end_quote

- In a twist that I legit did not expect, it now all comes back round to history as a discipline. I somehow stumbled upon the "right" side of philosophy for me to dive into.

#+begin_quote
  /The appeal to tradition need not at all be traditional, insofar as what the notion of tradition is attempting to recover is something missing, forgotten, or repressed in contemporary life. As such, the appeal to tradition need not be some conservative acquiescence in the face of the past, but can rather take the form of a critical confrontation with the history of philosophy and history as such./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Philosophy in the Continental tradition has an emancipatory intent. For a philosopher, the real crisis would be a situation where crisis was not recognized. In such a world, philosophy would have no purpose, other than as a historical curiosity, an intellectual distraction, or a technical means of sharpening one’s common sense./
#+end_quote

- The problem for post-Kantian philosophers is that Kant posed some questions and issues related to dualism, but did not offer any substantially good resolution. So the Continental branch of philosophy has to grapple with how to deal with these issues.

#+begin_quote
  /Nihilism is the breakdown of the order of meaning, where all that was posited as a transcendent source of value in pre-Kantian metaphysics becomes null and void, where there are no cognitive skyhooks upon which to hang a meaning for life. All transcendent claims for a meaning to life have been reduced to mere values – in Kant the reduction of God and the immortality of the soul to the status of postulates of pure practical reason – and those values have become incredible, standing in need of what Nietzsche calls ‘transvaluation’ or ‘revaluation’./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /That is, philosophy is a critique of existing social praxis, as a variety of unfree or unjust praxis, that aspires towards some goal of individual or collective emancipation. The traditions differ – and differ utterly – in what they think such emancipation might consist in./
#+end_quote

- Rudolf Carnap: empiricism
- Martin Heidegger: hermeneutics
- Carnap and the Vienna Circle regarded metaphysics as inferior to empirical science, even meaningless.
- The two sides' political alignments would prove powerful in how later generations view their philosophies: The Vienna Circle, mostly Jews, adopted leftist ideals and fled from Germany in the 1930s. Heidegger, a bona fide member of the Nazi Party, would become a stain on the metaphysics camp.

#+begin_quote
 /The interest of the Heidegger–Carnap conflict does not consist in deciding who is right and who is wrong, but rather in viewing that conflict as a definitive expression of both a philosophical problematic and a cultural pathology that are still very much with us. If this is not recognized, then we risk a fruitless philosophical stalemate, namely the stand-off between scientism on the one hand and obscurantism on the other./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Continental philosophy has been reduced to a list of proper names, with various competing methodologies attached, that one could survey with enthusiasm, bewilderment, or indifference during one or a series of introductory courses, or by reading books like this one. In my view, it is no longer a question of worshipping a series of proper names, but of doing something with what they left behind; doing creative, inventive thematic work and not restricting oneself to translation and commentary. Philosophy must be clearly argued conceptual creation in critical relation to given traditions of thinking, and not a melancholic mourning for missed opportunities or a mere technique for sharpening one’s common sense./

* IMAGINED COMMUNITIES
** /Benedict Anderson/

#+begin_quote
  /Nationality, or, as one might prefer to put it in view of that word’s multiple significations, nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artefacts of a particular kind. To understand them properly we need to consider carefully how they have come into historical being, in what ways their meanings have changed over time, and why, today, they command such profound emotional legitimacy. I will be trying to argue that the creation of these artefacts towards the end of the eighteenth century was the spontaneous distillation of a complex ‘crossing’ of discrete historical forces; but that, once created, they became ‘modular,’ capable of being transplanted, with varying degrees of self-consciousness, to a great variety of social terrains, to merge and be merged with a correspondingly wide variety of political and ideological constellations. I will also attempt to show why these particular cultural artefacts have aroused such deep attachments./

  /No more arresting emblems of the modern culture of nationalism exist than cenotaphs and tombs of Unknown Soldiers.

  /If the manner of a man’s dying usually seems arbitrary, his mortality is inescapable. Human lives are full of such combinations of necessity and chance. We are all aware of the contingency and ineluctability of our particular genetic heritage, our gender, our life-era, our physical capabilities, our mother-tongue, and so forth. The great merit of traditional religious world-views (which naturally must be distinguished from their role in the legitimation of specific systems of domination and exploitation) has been their concern with man-in-the-cosmos, man as species being, and the contingency of life. The extraordinary survival over thousands of years of Buddhism, Christianity or Islam in dozens of different social formations attests to their imaginative response to the overwhelming burden of human suffering – disease, mutilation, grief, age, and death./

  /The great weakness of all evolutionary/progressive styles of thought, not excluding Marxism, is that such questions are answered with impatient silence. At the same time, in different ways, religious thought also responds to obscure intimations of immortality, generally by transforming fatality into continuity (karma, original sin, etc.). In this way, it concerns itself with the links between the dead and the yet unborn, the mystery of regeneration./

- Not even 10% into chapter 2, the author already namedropped Filipino stuff like Sulu Archipelago, Maguindanao, and Ilongo Christian. I got super intrigued and searched up his wiki bio. Well, he's a Southeast Asia scholar, and does know Tagalog. He apparently even has a work about Rizal's novels.

  /The astonishing power of the papacy in its noonday is only comprehensible in terms of a trans-European Latin-writing clerisy, and a conception of the world, shared by virtually everyone, that the bilingual intelligentsia, by mediating between vernacular and Latin, mediated between earth and heaven./

#+begin_quote
  /Kingship organizes everything around a high centre. Its legitimacy derives from divinity, not from populations, who, after all, are subjects, not citizens. In the modern conception, state sovereignty is fully, flatly, and evenly operative over each square centimetre of a legally demarcated territory. But in the older imagining, where states were defined by centres, borders were porous and indistinct, and sovereignties faded imperceptibly into one another. Hence, paradoxically enough, the ease with which pre-modern empires and kingdoms were able to sustain their rule over immensely heterogeneous, and often not even contiguous, populations for long periods of time./
#+end_quote

- Halfway through chapter 2, the author is now analyzing Rizal's and Balagtas' works haha.
- One early example of how capitalism spreads is with print publishing. Once the market for Latin-reading elite has been saturated, publishers moved on to vernacular audiences. The spread of ideas from printed publications was, in a way, a product of capitalistic pursuits.
  
#+begin_quote
  /The coalition between Protestantism and print-capitalism, exploiting cheap popular editions, quickly created large new reading publics – not least among merchants and women, who typically knew little or no Latin – and simultaneously mobilized them for politico-religious purposes. Inevitably, it was not merely the Church that was shaken to its core. The same earthquake produced Europe’s first important non-dynastic, non-city states in the Dutch Republic and the Commonwealth of the Puritans./

#+begin_quote
  /The universality of Latin in mediaeval Western Europe never corresponded to a universal political system. The contrast with Imperial China, where the reach of the mandarinal bureaucracy and of painted characters largely coincided, is instructive. In effect, the political fragmentation of Western Europe after the collapse of the Western Empire meant that no sovereign could monopolize Latin and make it his-and-only-his language-of-state, and thus Latin’s religious authority never had a true political analogue./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /It is likely that the esotericization of Latin, the Reformation, and the haphazard development of administrative vernaculars are significant, in the present context, primarily in a negative sense – in their contributions to the dethronement of Latin. It is quite possible to conceive of the emergence of the new imagined national communities without any one, perhaps all, of them being present. What, in a positive sense, made the new communities imaginable was a half-fortuitous, but explosive, interaction between a system of production and productive relations (capitalism), a technology of communications (print), and the fatality of human linguistic diversity./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In a pre-print age, the reality of the imagined religious community depended profoundly on countless, ceaseless travels. Nothing more impresses one about Western Christendom in its heyday than the uncoerced flow of faithful seekers from all over Europe, through the celebrated ‘regional centres’ of monastic learning, to Rome. These great Latin-speaking institutions drew together what today we would perhaps regard as Irishmen, Danes, Portuguese, Germans, and so forth, in communities whose sacred meaning was every day deciphered from their members’ otherwise inexplicable juxtaposition in the refectory./
#+end_quote

- The author is hammering the connection of highly literate sectors of society with 'print capitalism', which together helped spread the use of vernaculars, which in turn facilitated the conceptualization of a unified identity among speakers of similar languages. Hence, nationalism.

#+begin_quote
  /An illiterate bourgeoisie is scarcely imaginable. Thus in world-historical terms bourgeoisies were the first classes to achieve solidarities on an essentially imagined basis. But in a nineteenth-century Europe in which Latin had been defeated by vernacular print-capitalism for something like two centuries, these solidarities had an outermost stretch limited by vernacular legibilities. To put it another way, one can sleep with anyone, but one can only read some people’s words./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The general growth in literacy, commerce, industry, communications and state machineries that marked the nineteenth century created powerful new impulses for vernacular linguistic unification within each dynastic realm. Latin hung on as a language-of-state in Austro-Hungary as late as the early 1840s, but it disappeared almost immediately thereafter. Language-of-state it might be, but it could not, in the nineteenth century, be the language of business, of the sciences, of the press, or of literature, especially in a world in which these languages continuously interpenetrated one another./

  /If Kaiser Wilhelm II cast himself as ‘No. 1 German,’ he implicitly conceded that he was one among many of the same kind as himself, that he had a representative function, and therefore could, in principle, be a traitor to his fellow-Germans (something inconceivable in the dynasty’s heyday. Traitor to whom or to what?). In the wake of the disaster that overtook Germany in 1918, he was taken at his implied word. Acting in the name of the German nation, civilian politicians (publicly) and the General Staff (with its usual courage, secretly) sent him packing from the Fatherland to an obscure Dutch suburb./

  /The First World War brought the age of high dynasticism to an end. By 1922, Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, Romanovs and Ottomans were gone. In place of the Congress of Berlin came the League of Nations, from which non-Europeans were not excluded. From this time on, the legitimate international norm was the nation-state, so that in the League even the surviving imperial powers came dressed in national costume rather than imperial uniform. After the cataclysm of World War II the nation-state tide reached full flood. By the mid-1970s even the Portuguese Empire had become a thing of the past./

- The colonials who were educated in Europe and recruited back into the colonial governments became the last wave of linguistic nationalists. Their intermingling with the metropolitans in Europe fueled the idea that nationalism ought not be defined merely by common language.
- Monolingual European metropolitans -> Bilingual colonials -> Monolingual colonials

#+begin_quote
  /The intelligentsias were central to the rise of nationalism in the colonial territories, not least because colonialism ensured that native agrarian magnates, big merchants, industrial entrepreneurs, and even a large professional class were relative rarities. Almost everywhere economic power was either monopolized by the colonialists themselves, or unevenly shared with a politically impotent class of pariah (non-native) businessmen – Lebanese, Indian and Arab in colonial Africa, Chinese, Indian, and Arab in colonial Asia. It is no less generally recognized that the intelligentsias’ vanguard role derived from their bilingual literacy, or rather literacy and bilingualism. Print-literacy already made possible the imagined community floating in homogeneous, empty time of which we have spoken earlier. Bilingualism meant access, through the European language-of-state, to modern Western culture in the broadest sense, and, in particular, to the models of nationalism, nationness, and nation-state produced elsewhere in the course of the nineteenth century./
#+end_quote

- In the colonies, nationalist movements were lead by the young people, mainly because they were the first generations to grow up in Western-style colonial education.
- Switzerland was a largely rural and economically small country prior to WW2.

#+begin_quote
  /In an age when it is so common for progressive, cosmopolitan intellectuals (particularly in Europe?) to insist on the near-pathological character of nationalism, its roots in fear and hatred of the Other, and its affinities with racism, it is useful to remind ourselves that nations inspire love, and often profoundly self-sacrificing love. The cultural products of nationalism – poetry, prose fiction, music, plastic arts – show this love very clearly in thousands of different forms and styles. On the other hand, how truly rare it is to find analogous nationalist products expressing fear and loathing. Even in the case of colonized peoples, who have every reason to feel hatred for their imperialist rulers, it is astonishing how insignificant the element of hatred is in these expressions of national feeling./

- After this passage, author then cites Rizal's /Mi Ultimo Adios/. Chef's kiss.

#+begin_quote
  /While it is true that in the past two decades the idea of the family-as-articulated-power-structure has been much written about, such a conception is certainly foreign to the overwhelming bulk of mankind. Rather, the family has traditionally been conceived as the domain of disinterested love and solidarity. So too, if historians, diplomats, politicians, and social scientists are quite at ease with the idea of ‘national interest,’ for most ordinary people of whatever class the whole point of the nation is that it is interestless. Just for that reason, it can ask for sacrifices./

#+begin_quote
  /There is a special kind of contemporaneous community which language alone suggests – above all in the form of poetry and songs. Take national anthems, for example, sung on national holidays. No matter how banal the words and mediocre the tunes, there is in this singing an experience of simultaneity. At precisely such moments, people wholly unknown to each other utter the same verses to the same melody./
#+end_quote

- It is precisely in the idea of nationalism being "imagined" that it is an expression of unity and selfless love. Nation invites belongingness and inclusivity. In contrast, racism seeks to exclude and discriminate, to highlight the unchosen qualities, especially race and color, and use it to impose fear and division.
- Author also highlights Makario Sakay's Constitution for the Tagalog Republic, to emphasize that reverse racism is hardly ever a thing, and that the sense of nationalism among colonials actually harbored a sense of equality among all races.



* LOST IN MATH
** /Sabine Hossenfelder/

- Author argues that scientists - physicists specifically - should not let the concepts of beauty and aesthetics to dictate their theories.
- It's impossible to test all hypotheses, and some criteria have to be used to determine viability of each. Author contends that aesthetics as such a criteria isn't the way to go.
- Math is most useful as representation of reality. Math is used to formulate theories, and when tested and proved true, it suffices even if the result isn't directly observable.
- The problem with Schrodinger's cat is that the question looks at the state of the cat upon opening the box. The actual mystery that should be solved is what the cat's state /before/ opening the box. This illustrates the underlying problem of quantum mechanics.

  /Quantum mechanics is spectacularly successful. It explains the atomic world and the subatomic world with the highest precision. We’ve tested it upside-down and inside-out, and found nothing wrong with it. Quantum mechanics has been right, right, and right again. But despite this, or maybe because of this, nobody likes it. We’ve just gotten used to it./

  /I try to imagine the day when we’ll just feed all cosmological data to an artificial intelligence (AI). We now wonder what dark matter and dark energy are, but this question might not even make sense to the AI. It will just make predictions. We will test them. And if the AI is consistently right, then we’ll know it’s succeeded at finding and extrapolating the right patterns. That thing, then, will be our new concordance model. We put in a question, out comes an answer—and that’s it./

  /Black holes form when a sufficiently large amount of matter collapses under the gravitational pull of its own mass. If the matter fails to build up sufficient internal pressure—for example, because a star has exhausted all its fuel—then it can continue to collapse until concentrated in a single point. Once the matter is concentrated enough, the gravitational pull at its surface becomes so strong that not even light can escape: a black hole has been created. The boundary of the trapping region is called the “event horizon.” Light launched directly at the horizon will just about fail to escape, going around in a circle forever, and since nothing travels faster than light, nothing can escape from inside the black hole./

* MAGISTERIA
** /Nicholas Spencer/

- The book's title comes from Stephen Jay Gould's description of science and religion as being "non-overlapping magisteria".

#+begin_quote
  /as is frustratingly often the case with history, the truth is rather more complex and convoluted than the myths. Neither the specific encounters nor the master narrative hung from them turns out to be the morality play that has passed into the popular imagination./

- The main narrative of war between science and religion began in the wake of Darwin's work on theory of evolution. Medieval examples, like with Galileo and Copernicus, were revived in the 19th century in the course of evolution debates.

#+begin_quote
  /Myth-busting is helpful and can be fun but it can still leave a rather negative impression in the mind. Religion wasn’t quite as destructive of science as we have been led to believe. Hallelujah! Rejoice! In actual fact, for much of history, religion wasn’t just ‘not at war’ with science, but it actively supported it, serving to legitimise, preserve, encourage and develop scientific ideas and activities./

  /Time and time again, it is the concept of the human – our makeup, origins, purpose, dignity and uniqueness (or lack thereof) – that emerges from the debate. Time and again, when it seemed as if people were arguing about the power of the planets, the composition of the body, the order of the cosmos, the design of nature, the origin of life, the age of rocks or the development of species, they were really talking about the nature of the human beast./

- It was a biographer of Columbus, Washington Irving, that popularized the false notion that flat earth belief was widespread prior to the discovery of the New World.
- Copernicus has formed his heliocentric model decades before publishing it. For various reasons, he dragged his foot on the publication. The author implicitly argues that Copernicus would've been more well-received if he published earlier, during more accomodating conditions under friendlier church leaders. This argument does have some hindsight bias.
- Copernicus' protege, Rheticus, consulted a protestant friend named Andreus Osiander to review the work. Osiander offered to write a preface, in which he downplayed the impact of the work, insisting that readers treat it more as thought experiment rather than actual truth. Rheticus declined, but the preface somehow got into the final version anyway. Osiander's preface has both undermined the book's scientific value, while also further degrading copernicus' reputation with the church authorities, all within the unfolding drama of Reformation and Counter-Reformation.
- Galileo's trial was an issue of the Church imposing both theological and philosophical authority over the field of sciences. It was less about what his work actually says, but about who decides its merits. It does make me feel bad for Galileo, as he seem to have been a good Catholic until the end.

  /Nobody found or lost God on account of relativity or quantum theory. For all that the new physics adjusted the foundations of reality, few imagined that it brought the religious house down, if only because there was no longer one built above it. Newton had famously claimed that he had had his eye on how his system might work ‘with considering men for the belief of a Deity’, but after the work of Laplace and the fall of Paley, no one based their religion on Newtonian physics. And that meant that when physics was remodelled in the early twentieth century, there were no religious beliefs or doctrines built on it that could come crashing down./

* MAOISM
** /Julia Lovell/

#+begin_quote
  /For Maoism is an unstable political creed that simultaneously reveres centralised party and mass leadership, collective obedience and anti-state rebellion. In its global journeys, Maoism has served causes that questioned or attacked existing governments; in its country of origin, it has created an omnipotent party state. It has lionised peasant revolution, while winning many of its followers or sympathisers from educated elites (Louis Althusser, Jean-Paul Sartre, Michel Foucault, Baburam Bhattarai, Abimael Guzmán) – it has been a revolution spread through books./

- For a few years since inception, the CCP was more intellectual and less violent, its members mostly nonchalant and had little expectations. It was in the wake of the 1927 massacre of Communists that the Party became convinced of the need to raise an army and resort to violent struggle.
- Mao was a lot more grassroots and peasant-centric in his ways than other Communist leaders over the world; in contrast, Lenin and Stalin ruled the Soviet Union, and dictated over the Comintern branches in multiple countries, from within Kremlin.
- The Rectification Purge of 1942-1943 was a combination of "thought reform" and lynching, aimed at imposing absolute fealty to Mao and the CCP. The manner of intimidation and intimidation tactics used to keep comrades in line later gained notoriety in the West, and in the US it was given a new name: "brainwashing".

#+begin_quote
  /The consolidation of the PRC coincided with a global upsurge in decolonisation across Africa, Asia and the Middle East in the wake of the Second World War. That context did not exist for the Soviet Union’s own anti-imperial ventures in the 1920s. Even though nationalists in, for example, Indonesia had already authored their own strongly anti-colonial movements in the 1920s and 30s, and even though at no point in its history did the CCP contribute as much materially to global anti-colonial rebellions as the Soviet Union – which also funnelled millions of roubles per year, in addition to military aid and training, to the Chinese revolution during the 1920s alone – this historical coincidence enabled the PRC under Mao to present itself as the global headquarters of anti-imperialism./

#+begin_quote
  /Between 1949 and 1976, the CCP created a lavish and exhaustively orchestrated hospitality machine, designed to distract from or conceal discordant realities, and to cater to the whims of carefully chosen foreign guests, in the hope and expectation that, on leaving the Chinese state, they would proselytise the virtues of the Communists and their government. In this, they drew but also elaborated on the machinery built through the 1920s and 30s by the Soviet Union./

- The author basically makes a case for Edgar Snow's "Red Star Over China" as a significant influence in spread of Maoism, and in positive portrayal of Mao Zedong to the world.
- Overall I think Snow and his work was judged quite fairly. It is influential, but ultimately Snow had some lapses that helped hide the ugly and evil side of Mao and the CCP.
- The fear of massive brainwashing campaigns, especially on Korean War POWs, prompted the US government to conduct secretive projects to reverse-engineer Communist brainwashing. MK-Ultra is one such project.
- Though Eisenhower's domino theory is most associated with the Vietnam War, it originated with fears of the consequence of Malayan Emergency, the Malayan Communist Party's campaign against British colonial rule.
- In the 1950s, Mao set up an academy to educate and train Communists from all over Asia. Some of its graduates include Mohit Sen of India, and Chen Ping of Malaya, later also the initiator of the Malayan Emergency.
- CCP's support of overseas Communist Parties were secondary to China's self-interest. Many times the CCP nudged its foreign comrades to tone down revolutionary activities to fit Beijing's current diplomatic needs.
- Mao had much pressing internal needs to focus on during the late 1940s to early 1950s, and almost didn't support Kim Il-Sung in the Korean War.
- Sino-North Korean relations at this period were more patchy than usually known in the West, and the author even argues that Pyongyang is diplomatically much closer to Moscow than to Beijing. Kim is himself handpicked by Stalin, and had a hard time gaining Mao's support.

#+begin_quote
  /Mao was, therefore, bounced into the Korean War – not as part of a long-term conspiracy, but through Stalin’s self-interested impulses and instinct for playing on Mao’s status-conscious desire to claim leadership of the Asian revolution. Given that Mao and his immediate lieutenants had already committed themselves so publicly to leading the world revolution – with their Beijing training courses, their proclamations about the relevance of China to oppressed people in Asia – their international revolutionary credentials would have been shredded had they not stepped into the war. Stalin and Kim, in short, created a conflict that impinged not only on one of China’s most sensitive, complex frontiers – the Korean–Soviet–Chinese border – but also on Mao’s self-image. The Chinese were thus forced to rescue Kim when the war turned against the North Koreans./

  /High Maoism – as I call it here – showcased a peculiar form of internationalism: universal in theory, parochial in practice. It made a utopian case for the global relevance of Maoism, while engaging in petty doctrinal disputes with the Soviet Union. It bid for a world role while destroying China’s diplomatic relations in almost every part of the world. It shouted about universal solidarity while asserting Mao’s planetary leadership. It was often more about domestic/ amour propre /than international realpolitik./

- Mao was the one who coined the term "de-Stalinization", and rejected such policy which Khrushchev pursued after taking power.

#+begin_quote
  /Indonesia was the test case in China’s post-Soviet foreign policy: a key strategic target for exporting the wisdom and superiority of the Maoist model. Leading Indonesian Communists were intoxicated by the militant rhetoric of Mao’s revolution in the early 1960s. It encouraged and inspired them to confront the Indonesian military; this decision in turn gave the army a pretext to trigger the horrors of 1965. Without Maoism, Indonesia’s catastrophe in 1965 is hard to imagine./

- The extent of CCP's involvement in September 30th incident remains unclear. But it's likely that Mao at a minimum approved of the coup attempt, which was executed by a small faction within the PKI.
- Mao initiated decades of Chinese foreign policy in Africa, pouring vast amounts of aid to the continent, in exhange for influence and control of raw materials. In fact China spent a greater percentage of their budget for foreign aid than wealthier Western countries, at a time when the Chinese people themselves desperately need the finances.
- I probably would struggle with the Africa chapter if I haven't read an African history book before. But I finished reading *The Fate of Africa* weeks prior, so I am now acquainted with the persons and events discussed in this chapter.
- China's push for African influence is definitely more nuanced than common perspectives from either ends of the spectrum. It's likely that CCP genuinely wanted to promote Maoism in a continent already predisposed to welcoming anti-Western rhetoric.
- One more significant result of China's pivot to Africa is official UN recognition of PRC (vs. ROC). In 1971, it was the African states that tipped the scales to favor Beijing, finally earning them a seat not only in UN itself but also in the Security Council.

#+begin_quote
  /It was Maoist China’s threatening potential that helped create world-changing events: the Vietnam War, and its many consequences (the global protest movements of 1968, Watergate, the US’s unconscionable decision to prop up the exiled Khmer Rouge insurgency through the 1980s). Together, they significantly undermined US power and prestige in the world./

- The situation in Indochina during the Cold War was less straightforward than Western analysts saw. The domino theory held sway to some extent, in that both China and Vietnam actually partly subscribed to it. However, both China and Cambodia also viewed Vietnam as an expansionist power.
- After the fall of Vietnam, instead of dominoes falling, what resulted was even more conflict within Indochina, now between Vietnam and Cambodia. Interestingly, US foreign policy under Kissinger threw support behind Cambodia against Vietnam.

#+begin_quote
  /Though discredited today, the domino theory gave a fairly accurate account of Chinese Communist ambitions in Indochina. Confidential conversations between Chinese and Vietnamese leaders from the 1950s to the 1970s turned regularly to an overarching project of world revolution. The horror of the Vietnam War was explicitly justified because, in Zhou Enlai’s words, it was fought ‘for the world revolution’ as well as for Vietnam. It was, in China’s view, a key domino whose fall would have ramifications for the rest of Asia./

- In the 1954 Geneva Conference after the Dien Bien Phu debacle, the CCP urged the North Vietnamese communists to postpone Indochinese unification, lest they invite a united front of the US and Western powers.

#+begin_quote
  /Although the DRV was eager to export Communist-led insurgency to Laos and Cambodia, to create an ‘Indochina Federation’, Zhou Enlai and his fellow Chinese diplomats were wary of a Vietnamese-dominated military alliance between the three countries, and had done their best to shut the idea down. The Vietnamese Communists would always resent the Chinese for pressuring them to accept a suboptimal outcome – a divided Vietnam – at a time when they were confident that reunification by force was within reach./
#+end_quote

- The DRV continued to desire immediate unification, even as the US began intensifying its military campaign. The Sino-Soviet split further fueled Vietnamese animosity, as China insisted on blocking Soviet aid to Indochina.
- More importantly, the Vietnamese were not completely blind to the failures of Mao's Great Leap Forward. Ironically, the Vietnamese communists were becoming more disillusioned with the CCP at the same time that Western sentiment begins swaying in favor of the Vietnamese and Maoism.
- The falling out between Vietnam and China became more evident after the end of Vietnam War, as China now pivoted towards Cambodia. In a geopolitical sense, China's goal was to use Cambodia as lynchpin against an expansionist Vietnam. Within the CCP, Mao considered Pol Pot's Cambodia as the best culmination of Maoism outside China.

#+begin_quote
  /While the culture and politics of Cultural Revolution China permeated Western radicalism during the 1960s and 70s, this remains one of the significantly under-told stories of this epochal moment of cultural revolution. Mao and his ideas of continuous, peasant revolution appealed to both left-wing rebels, and civil rights campaigners. Within Europe, Mao’s Cultural Revolution galvanised Dadaist student protest, nurtured feminist and gay rights activism, and legitimised urban guerrilla terrorism. In the United States, it bolstered a broad programme of anti-racist civil rights campaigns, as well as sectarian Marxist–Leninist party-building./
#+end_quote

- Part of the author's general thesis in the book is that Maoism is so understudied and largely ignored, despite having very wide and deep repercussions throughout the Cold War and beyond.

  /Since the quashing of the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and with the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Soviet Union no longer represented an emancipatory alternative to the forces of capitalist oppression.

- Maoism provided a framework and platform with which discontented people were able to voice their criticisms of the prevailing system. In the US, this meant anti-Vietnam protests and civil rights movement.

  /In this utopian, politically promiscuous phase, many radical students in Germany, France, Italy and Norway picked up on the superficial, anarchic aspects of Maoism that appealed, and overlooked the rest. To be fair, they were not the first Westerners to exoticise China for their own purposes. Since the West began engaging in concerted outreach towards China – with the sixteenth-century launch of missionary overtures – the ‘celestial empire’ has been viewed by churchmen, merchants and philosopher-intellectuals as a potent dreamland of near-paradisiacal opportunity: for Christian conversion, for economic profit, for lessons in government. The embrace of Maoism by Western radicals is therefore a recent repeat of an age-old predisposition towards identifying conveniently remote, exotic China as a repository of political, social, cultural and economic virtue. The Cultural Revolution fever of the 1960s and beyond once more showcased the ability of Westerners to create an imaginary China largely divorced from empirical reality./

#+begin_quote
  /After 1968, Cultural Revolution Maoism in Western Europe and the US discovered its authoritarian roots. Mao the provocative jester became Mao the tough party man. As the student movement lost momentum or disintegrated in the face of state repression, Mao and the CCP provided a blueprint for creating disciplined, militarised parties that could carry out grass-roots revolutionary work in factories – and sometimes the countryside – and orchestrate confrontational street protests./
#+end_quote

- The failure of the 1968 protests throughout the world, but most especially in Europe, pushed Maoists into adopting more violent methods for struggle. This fueled the rise of terrorist groups in the 1970s and 1980s.

  /Mao-style criticism/self-criticism later blurred into the confessional habits of therapy and self-help. The Cultural Revolution-inspired dissent of the 1960s and 70s contributed to reforms of secondary and higher education, to make teaching methods and curricula more participatory, more representative, more accountable to diverse communities. African or Chinese American activists (such as John Bracey, at the University of Massachusetts from 1972), who stayed in the educational system rather than joining radical parties, contributed to the struggle for black and ethnic studies in universities./

  /The type of political activism practised in these parties was not, in any case, practically sustainable over the long term. It was divisive and time-consuming. There wasn’t much money in it. By the late 1970s this first generation of would-be revolutionaries were hitting thirty and were starting to think about families, careers and pensions. And much of this activism ran out of steam when governments in countries badly affected by left-wing terrorism cracked down hard on these groups, and anyone deemed to be a sympathiser./

- Even for the Maoists themselves, it's widely acknowledged that the division that Maoism caused within the left has aided the subsequent resurgence of conservatism, especially during the Reagan and Thatcher regimes.

#+begin_quote
  /The Cultural Revolution’s rhetoric of anti-authoritarian rebellion inspired revolts outside China that took aim at a broad range of political, cultural and social custom: at domestic and foreign policy; colonial rule; electoral representation; relations between the sexes; education, film and literature. The impact of the Cultural Revolution (upper case) is part of a much more diffuse (and often liberalising) process of cultural revolution (lower case) that has transformed society, culture and politics since the 1960s, especially in the developed West. In countries riven by deep historical, ethnic or socio-economic fault (post-fascist Germany and Italy; post-segregation America; post-independence India), the Cultural Revolution’s legitimisation of political violence served as the spark that lit a prairie fire – a fire that in some instances is still burning today./

  /Across the Latin American left as a whole, Mao’s analysis of pre-revolutionary China resonated in a continent marked by inequality and US economic domination.

- One advantage that the /Sendero Luminoso/ held is its academic origins. Abimael Guzman used his position as professor to recruit peers and students. Later the organization would grow by recruiting more intellectuals, which made it easier to convince average folks to side with them.
- This was also a double-edged sword, as the party leadership is decisively non-proletarian, and the higher-ups held a condescending view of the ordinary peasants.
- On describing women's roles within the /Sendero Luminoso/, the author used the term "Machismo-Leninismo", which I think is clever and appropriate for the context.
- An accident of circumstances that aided the rise of /senderistas/ is the political climate of the 1980s. Military dictatorship has recently ended, and the new democratic government is both burdened by security issues and aversion to heavy-handed law enforcement.
- Guzman's primary strategy is to utilize an overwhelming amount of violence, that the state is also then forced to resort to scorched earth tactics to purge the insurgency. It worked, and immensely helped the senderistas while further eroding trust on the government.

#+begin_quote
  /Shining Path, from the start, was no mass line, but rather a centralised, top-down model, in which local communities were both idealised and dictated to. In other words, Guzmán yearned for the ‘blank page’ so beloved of Mao, on which he could write beautiful, new things. It was Guzmán’s frustrated encounter with a Peruvian society that was far from blank that generated the atrocities of Shining Path./
#+end_quote

- The extreme violence and suffering that haunted Peru throughout the /senderistas'/ insurgency ended rather quickly. In 1992 Guzman, struck with psoriasis, was captured and presented to the public, his physical form a far cry from his past known appearances.
- After his capture, the /Sendero Luminoso/ lost momentum and its multiple fronts folded within months. Guzman himself publicly called on his followers to negotiate with the government.
- The most lasting legacy of /Sendero Luminoso/ is the erosion of democracy, which also lead to the rise of dictator Alberto Fujimori, under whom Guzman was captured. Fujimori fled after a decade of rule, having left Peru saddled with debt and massive corruption.

#+begin_quote
  /The Maoist insurgency in central eastern India today would not have been possible without the intersection of three elements in the 1960s: the existence of an impatient, militant wing of the Communist Party of India (CPI), a deep socio-economic and political crisis in India two decades after independence, and the eagerness of the Chinese Communist Party to support rhetorically (and in limited ways materially) an Indian revolution inspired by Maoist revolutionary strategies./
#+end_quote

- A 1967 peasant protest in Naxalbari that was violently suppressed by state police ignited the violent Maoist insurgency in India. These insurgents have since become known as the Naxalites.
- The group's leader, Charu Mazumdar, desperately wanted to leave his lasting legacy, and be as admired as Chairman Mao. This lead to disorganized and sometimes contradictory actions, like assassinations of fellow communists from another CPI faction. It also lead to the fallout with his deputy, Kanu Sanyal.
- Even worse, in the 1972 Pakistani war against Bangladeshis, China out of its own geopolitical interests sided with Pakistan. This forced the Naxalites to take the same side as Beijing, in the process tolerating Pakistani abuses against the Bangladeshi rebels. This eroded the group's moral credibility even among other Indian communists.
- Mazumdar was captured in 1972, and likely due to his lifelong health woes, died a few days later. Afterwards, the Naxalites continued to split into multiple factions, and consequent Maoist violence involved inter-faction conflicts.
- One interesting takeaway from this book is the Maoist origin of the term "semi-colonial, semi-feudal", often parroted by left-wing groups here in the Philippines: /mala-kolonyal, mala-pyudal/.
- Maoist insurgency flared up again since the 1990s, as consequence of New Delhi's more liberalizing economic policies. In particular, the government sought to clear the mineral-rich states of Maoist rebellion so large-scale mining concessions can be properly set up.
- The relative success of Maoism in Nepal is due to rather peculiar conditions throughout its history. The monarchy clamped down on anti-monarchy dissent, but generally tolerated Maoism. But also, the Nepalese communists are splintered across several factions, and didn't engage in open armed rebellion until 1996.

#+begin_quote
  /The Nepali state was neglectful at best, exploitative and aggressive at worst. Those who clung on to power in Kathmandu hardly represented the socio-economic and ethnic diversity of the population in general; taxes were used to develop urban, rather than rural areas. The dysfunctionality of Nepal’s democracy, meanwhile, prevented (indeed still prevents) most administrations from pursuing the kind of coherent socio-economic reform programmes the country needed. The democratically elected governments formed after the restoration of multi-party politics in 1990 were mostly unstable coalitions. Between 1994 and 1999 alone, Nepal had at least (depending on how you count them) three different governments, rising and falling amid corruption scandals, cynical factionalism and votes of no-confidence./
#+end_quote

- Despite some relatively peaceful upstart, in the 1990s Maoism bcame more coercive and violent, and in 1996 Nepal devolved into civil war.
- The civil war ultimately ended with multi-party democracy and abolition of the monarchy. And while much progress has been made in social justice, decades-long systemic issues remained, hampered by Maoist emphasis on military methods for problem-solving.
- As part of China's "de-Maoification", records of CCP support for many Maoist groups abroad were expunged or tucked away within the archives. The CCP stopped funding these movements, and pursued pragmatic relations with right-wing governments.

- The rise of the Internet provided platform for neo-Maoists, who criticized modern China and denounced major figures.

- Despite all his parading of Maoism and Mao-style leadership, Xi is ultimately himself a victim of the Cultural Revolution, his family having suffered along the way.

* MEDIEVAL CHRISTIANITY
** /Kevin Madigan/

- Two crucial differences between Gnosticism and (early) Christianity:
  - Gnosticism's end goal is freedom from ignorance; For Christianity, it's freedom from sin.
  - In Gnosticism, such salvation from ignorance is attainable only by a few. In Christianity, the promise of salvation is extended to everyone, and ideally everyone will be capable of attaining it too.
- Boethius deliberately did not quote the Scriptures in his work consolation of Philosophy, as he meant it as a meditation on topics like the problem of evil, and free will, in a more philosophical manner.
- Celtic Christianity was a specific kind of Christianity practiced in the Britain and Ireland. It placed greater emphasis on monasticism than the rest of Europe. Even in hierarchy, monasteries and abbots became substitute to dioceses and bishops, respectively. It is not, however, heretical or schismatic. Celts were never on a brink of breaking with Rome.

#+begin_quote
  /No saint’s life from the early Middle Ages is very trustworthy, historically speaking, because medieval hagiographers were not interested in producing biographies but in writing edifying literature for those aspiring to sanctity. Indeed, it would be wrong to call hagiographers “authors". They were compilers of inspiring and exemplary religious literature./

  /No other service was so treasured as the monks’ capacity to pray for society. Monks were imagined by those who founded and supported them as a sort of spiritual militia; they fought against the society’s spiritual enemies, especially the archenemy Satan and his minions. Above all, donors of land and buildings expected that monks would satisfy for the sins they committed against God by their prayers. Punishing penances could be satisfied not by the sinner but by his surrogate, the monk; he performed by his liturgical prayers the penances accumulated by lay sinners./
#+end_quote

- The focus on monastic prayers to aid in salvation later resulted in most monks being ordained into the priesthood. This allowed them to perform the highest prayer that could be made - the Mass.

#+begin_quote
  /The essential work of the monks, from the point of view of the society that supported them, was intercessory prayer. A donor who endowed a monastery could be assured that no matter the enormity of his transgressions, regardless of the weight of sin he had accumulated, his penance would be “prayed down” by a community he founded, a community all then believed would exist in perpetuity. An institution that in Benedict’s time was isolated and profoundly disinclined to offer service to surrounding communities, one that concentrated on the supernatural aspirations of its monks, came to offer both civic and spiritual benefits without which early-medieval society found it could not live./

- Possibly an important factor for the growth of the Pope's temporal power is Rome's distance from the "Roman" Empire in Constantinople. The emperor's primary representative in the West is the exarch of Ravenna, who is also physically distant from Rome and had little to offer on the city's many issues. Hence, the people relied on their wealthiest and most prominent resident: the Bishop of Rome.
- A major innovation of Gregory the Great is the deployment of monks for missionary work. This became the precedent for religious orders in centuries to come, and reinforced Rome's power and authority over Christians in faraway territories.
- Author briefly touched on the controversial Donation of Constantine. The document was a forgery from the 8th century, and has been argued to have been used to support papal supremacy. However, the document wasn't used for such purposes in the succeeding centuries, and by the early 11th century has already been proven to be fake.
- In Germanic lands, the most common type of church is a proprietary church. It's a small church built by the local lord, who also appoints the local clergy and simply gives visiting privileges to the bishop.
- Though clerical celibacy has been the tradition for centuries, the appointed priests for proprietary churches can be married men, even ones with concubines. The parishioners themselves were mostly indifferent about this, only grateful to have a local clergy to depend on.

  /Although a few bishops and some synods in the early Middle Ages insisted on clerical continence, their words were a dead letter. Simply put, virtually no rural parishioner or priest in the year 1000 regarded clerical concubinage or marriage as practically or canonically objectionable; it would be more than a century before this would change and we begin to have evidence of reforming lay groups demanding clerical celibacy. Given the difficulties of rural life, the economic motivations for having a wife, and the peasant origins of the clerical clergy, it was doubtless the case that celibacy was thought by many to be too lofty an ideal; some were probably even unaware that clerical concubinage or marriage was uncanonical. Additionally, the indifference or ignorance of parishioners and priests was reinforced by a regime of imperfect episcopal supervision, not to mention that the practices around clerical education and formation were barely adequate, and to describe them as such is being charitable./

  /Part of medieval culture was a dynamic interaction between elements of the Christian faith sponsored by priests and those given life or popularity by the people. In attempting to understand medieval Christianity, we stray far from the truth if we imagine priests and people as inhabiting two different worlds of thought and practice or if we believe that the experience of ordinary medieval folk can be captured in the vocabulary of folklore and with the social scientific tools used to describe it today./

- Though Jews were indeed, at times, persecuted in Medieval Europe, by and large they didn't live in desolation all those times. Many anti-Jewish policies and laws were "implemented", but in the sense that they were put into legal writing, but were ignored in practice anyway.
- In the early Middle Ages, the Church has sought help from secular rulers for protection. This culminated in a papal anointed monarch, like Charlemagne, and later on the Holy Roman Emperors. But this dependence also meant that the secular rulers felt more entitled to ecclesiastical authority, even dressing themselves up like the bishops of the church. This arrangement, necessary at first but centuries later became less so, would be a factor in the ensuing Investiture Crisis.

#+begin_quote
  /The model of the ancient church and the “life of the apostles” (vita apostolica) were increasingly not just influential or suggestive. More and more, they were understood to be normative. As such, they superseded any practice that was regarded as merely customary or temporarily useful; evolution from ancient conventions slowly became seen as evidence of degeneration from treasured, pristine ideals, archetypes that the church ought, in the eyes of reformers, to embrace again. Reform was largely imagined, then, in terms of a restoration of usages that were imagined to have prevailed as disciplinary, ecclesiastical, moral, and legal norms in the apostolic age./

  /It was Dominic’s genius to perceive that no preachers could compete against the Cathars unless they could effectively preach, so to speak, as orthodox perfects. The conviction that learning, poverty, and fairly traditional monastic observance could prepare preachers for this task, combined with the profound confidence that heresy was intolerable for the church—and mortally dangerous to souls—gave Dominic’s new order its initial shape and mission, as well as many of its enduring features./

- St. Dominic adopted the Benedictine Rule for his new Order of Preachers, with modifications. After his death, his successors continued to further modify the Rule to more closely follow Dominic's vision for the order. One notable difference of the Dominicans with other orders is the absence of manual labor, replaced by study and, when applicable, preaching.

  /The differences between monastic and scholastic education can be, and have been, exaggerated. We need to remember that even those schools in cities were for clerics training for ordination. Almost needless to say, all “believed in” and serviced the Deity. No scholastic ever claimed to have invented a portion of revelation. Rather, he worked within the very framework of the deposit of faith and attempted, by the strict application of reason, to understand it more profoundly. In other words, in ways that may seem backward to some today, he sought to understand what he already knew to be so. Belief preceded understanding; the latter clarified and reinforced the former./

  /The domination of both spiritual and temporal realms was to prove costly, in every way, to the papacy. Secular authorities never accepted the papacy’s claims to temporal oversight. In the ecclesiastical realm, as popes increased their power, they also caused suspicion and frustration among the faithful. As popes claimed more and more authority and acquired more power over Christendom and as the curia became a sort of Supreme Court of Christendom, the successors of St. Peter, ever in need of more money, resorted to a tactic hated in the Middle Ages more than today: taxation. In many other ways, the papacy was believed to have departed from apostolic practice. These deviations from normative practice and the fathomless need for revenue slowly robbed the papacy of affection and respect, with profound consequences in the centuries to come./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The papacy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries began increasing taxes and fees for existing services and charging more and new taxes. Traditional papal revenues included income gained from papal landed estates and a number of other, relatively minor, sources, including Peter’s Pence, a small annual tax; tributes from monasteries under the protection of St. Peter; and so forth. The point of no return came when the papacy began to tax the income of the clergy. Initially, it did so to pay for the Crusades. Later, these funds were used indiscriminately, and the rates at which the clergy could be taxed were equally promiscuous. Finally, the tax went from being an occasional impost to becoming a general tax, from which the papacy derived a dependable stream of revenue by the mid-thirteenth century. There is some grim irony in contemplating that when it came to taxing its main constituency, the papal government was far ahead of its secular counterparts./
#+end_quote

- The roots of medieval conciliarism were planted throughout centuries, as papal power gradually increased and intensified. By the 13th and 14th centuries, power in the Church has been massively centralized to the pope and his curia. All sorts of taxation and petty penny-pinching have been implemented. The vicar of Christ has become more powerful and much wealthier than secular kings and emperors. All this will culminate in the rise of ecumenical councils targeted towards reforming the moribund papacy.

  /The language of worship, Latin, was not understood, at least not outside the Italian peninsula. This made weekly worship relatively ineffective as a medium of teaching and learning the faith. More insight into the faith they professed may well have been achieved by parishioners in extraordinary times, such as the feast of Good Friday, when the cross was adored, or on Easter, when a new fire was started—and in some parts of Europe, this fire would have been taken into homes. A very powerful impact indeed could have been achieved by these acts of nonverbal ritual and ceremony. Yet it remains true that clergy did not succeed in using worship as a mode of instruction, primarily because they did not even attempt to use it in that way./
#+end_quote

- It can be difficult to discern the purpose of imageries and icons in medieval churches because of much variety. But the author thinks it's unlikely they were effective as religious instruction. Many, like stained glasses, can look very abstract, and some are even placed too high to be comfortably viewed.

  /By 1300, the church’s lawyers had designated very precisely the conditions—thirteen in all—in which one could charge interest for loans. The new theology of confession and purgatory also helped ease the way for the church grudgingly to tolerate the practice of trade. Treatment of the sin of usury was relocated from the court to the confessional and thus to the conscience of the tradesman. This helped ease the way for the recognition that there was nothing intrinsically sinful in routine commercial transactions./

  /Indeed, the expression of this highly theoretical view of Roman authority coincided with the loss of actual power in the provincial churches, as kings and secular lords asserted their jurisdiction within their realms and created national churches from the ruins of a Christendom that had crumbled. In this, they reversed trends initiated and supported by the papacy since the eleventh century, when the popes had struggled to free the local churches from secular control. The royal powers were helped enormously by the schism, which accelerated the process of the disintegration of Christendom into territorial and national churches. With these powerful and irreversible trends, the theoretical claims of/ Laetentur Coeli /were in preposterous conflict. What seemed to matter to the popes was that claims be made as magnificent as possible, however impossible their chances of achieving actual expression./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /As these grand claims were made, popes in the century between ca. 1430 and 1530 concentrated their efforts on protecting their Italian domain and in lavishly reconstructing the city of Rome. It is not for nothing that these pontiffs are often called “Renaissance popes.” Posterity owes to them at least the glory of the Sistine Chapel and, more ambiguously, the construction of the new St. Peter’s Basilica. But it seems these popes were constantly enmeshed in war; Italian politics; conflict with the city-states; trafficking in ecclesiastical offices; elevating their relatives (including their children, of whom one pope sired sixteen) to high office; and in the generation and accumulation of art and treasure./

  /No matter how much one confessed, it was impossible to say if one was in a state of grace and justified in the eyes of God. Far from offering relief, the salvific instrumentalities of the late-medieval church could have encouraged hypersensitivity and doubt. In the end, what one group of Christians could feel as consolation, another could feel as anxiety-causing torment and, finally, un-Christian. When Christians split over this issue—on how they might be saved—when the same set of Christian practices and pastoral pieties could generate diametrically opposite emotional and religious responses; when one Christian, emerging from the confessional, could feel serene relief and another near-immediate doubt, the Christian Middle Ages can be said to have come to an end. It was profound disagreement over the issue of the media and mechanism of salvation, then, that did much to sunder the religious unity of the medieval Western church./

This for me is seriously mistaken. History is not teleological: that is to say, historical development does not go to; it goes from. Furthermore, as far as I am concerned, the medieval period, full of energy as it was, is interesting in and for itself; it does not need to be validated by any subsequent developments./

  /The self-servingness of much medieval religious rhetoric, particularly when it was the work of the powerful, can often be only too obvious to us; but it was not hypocritical.

  /When we are faced with really big events – the end of European peace in 1914, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 – historians tend to divide between those who see the catastrophe as inevitable, with structural causes, often long-term ones, which just happen to come together in a sudden shift, and those who see it as chance, the product of short-term, almost casual, political decisions; or else, when they are more nuanced, between those who, in the mélange of structural and political causes, put more weight on the former or else the latter./

  /What happened in the fifth century in the western Roman empire, put succinctly, is that ‘barbarian’ incursions from the north, although they had been a feature of most of imperial history, this time led to political breakdown: armies which did not call themselves Roman took over the different western provinces and carved out kingdoms for themselves./
#+end_quote

- Author argues that the fall of Carthage in 439 was the beginning of the "fall" of the Roman Empire. Without Africa, Rome lost revenue, then lost troops, then became dependent on "barbarian" armies, who finally took control for themselves.
- As individual Germanic tribes carved out their own provincial kingdoms for themselves, the centralized taxation system that leads back to Rome broke down. From here on, the main source of wealth for the many new kingdoms will be landowning.
- This point now ties in with another book by this author, *Framing the Early Middle Ages*.

  /The culture of the public, assembly politics, Christianity and the network of bishops, a disappearing tax system and the beginning of the politics of land, a less wealthy aristocracy and a more independent peasantry, a simpler economic system: all these features marked out the post-Roman kingdoms.

  /It was also only too easy for Christian polities to see Muslim ones as existential threats, and sometimes they acted on that imagery, as, most dramatically, at the time of the crusades; and it was certainly much harder for the Christian polities to learn from the Muslim ones, even when there was much to learn. We have to recognise this difference, while not being taken in by it./

- The political structure of the Carolingian Empire, starting with Charlemagne, is considered an innovation over the traditional Roman structure. Local units were still ruled by various local aristocrats, but their roles are more well-defined, and even bishops were granted judicial roles. Charlemagne also sent out bureaucrats to occasionally check on these local rulers and stamp out irregularities.

  /Up to the eleventh century, kings – and also regional rulers, dukes, counts and bishops – could rule from the top down, using the old Roman imagery of public power and the early medieval collective legitimation which was assembly politics, without considering in a very organised way what was going on locally, unless it involved disloyalty, or an injustice which was so clamorous that it actually reached their ears. The small-scale lordships of the late eleventh and twelfth centuries in France could not afford to be so detached; exactly whom they controlled, and how, mattered much more./

  /In the eleventh century, political power became more localised, and more carefully bounded.

- Author notes that despite the usual impression, medieval international exchange system wasn't particularly advanced enough that it could've caused Industrial Revolution much earlier if not for the Black Death.
- Europe is simply a periphery in the international mercantile system, of which Central and East Asia is the center. Even in the Mediterranean, until the 14th century, the primary trading hub is Egypt.
- In addition, the international exchange of goods is mostly a luxury trade. Most people bought and sold goods at the local level.

But this carried its own risks, not least the danger of disseminating heresy, and for this reason popes and other powers, both external and internal to universities, found themselves trying to micromanage: both the content of what was taught (as with, for example, how much Aristotle and Averroes could be taught, given that these authors were not Christian) and who could teach it (as with the perennial debate from the 1250s onwards about the role of friars in the university of Paris)./

  /Essentially, the political practices which the Ottomans inherited from the Arab-Turkish past – in particular the near-universal assumption that a paid standing army, with its own career structure, was a standard part of any political system – made it necessary for them to adopt and adapt whatever fiscal structures they found when they conquered, which meant, above all, those of the Byzantines. They soon turned this into a centralised system, adding new elements as well.

The General Assembly had, in general, less power than the League’s assembly had done and the five permanent members of the Security Council had more. They were equipped with their new veto-wielding prerogative, and to facilitate the policing role that Roosevelt had emphasized, they also gave themselves the power to call on their own military staff to coordinate security measures for the sake of world peace.

  /For four years the most advanced nations in the world had poured out their men, their wealth, the fruits of their industry, science and technology, on a war that may have started by accident but was impossible to stop because the two sides were too evenly balanced.

- The Paris Conference was planned to start out with a preliminary phase, to draft the terms, then present them to the other parties for negotiation. Instead, the preliminary discussions dragged on and became "the real thing". The agreement presented to Germany was not a draft; it was the final treaty.

  /People said at the time, as they have ever since, that the peacemakers took too long and that they got it wrong. It has become a commonplace to say that the peace settlements of 1919 were a failure, that they led directly to the Second World War. That is to overestimate their power./

  /It is tempting to say that the United States lost an opportunity to bend Europe to its will before the competing ideologies of fascism and communism could take hold. That is to read back into the past what we know about American power after another great war. In 1945, the United States was a superpower and the European nations were much weakened. In 1919, however, the United States was not yet significantly stronger than the other powers. The Europeans could ignore its wishes, and they did./

Wilson kept alive the hope that human society, despite the evidence, was getting better, that nations would one day live in harmony. In 1919, before disillusionment had set in, the world was more than ready to listen to him./

- Neither Wilson nor Lloyd George wanted the post-war conference to be held in Paris; a neutral city would've generally been the first and best option. But Clemenceau insisted, and so the Paris Conference came to be.

#+begin_quote
  /People have often assumed that, because Lloyd George opposed the Boer War, he was not an imperialist. This is not quite true. In fact, he had always taken great pride in the empire, but he had never thought it was being run properly. It was folly to try to manage everything from London and, he argued, an expensive folly at that.  would keep the empire strong was to allow as much local self-government as possible and to have an imperial policy only on the important issues, such as defense and a common foreign policy./

- Herbert Hoover was put in charge of Allied relief administration, tasked with managing food and aid distribution across war-torn Europe.
- When the Paris Conference started, Russia had no representatives. The country, now ruled by the Bolsheviks, is in disarray, and the rest of the Allies only have scant and sporadic rumor-filled information abotu what's happening in Russia.
- Clemenceau's view is that Russia under Lenin has betrayed the Allies by signing Brest-Litovsk.

  /The survivors of the Great War were weary and anxious. Apparently solid structures, empires, their civil services and their armies, had melted away and in many parts of Europe it was not clear what was to take their place. Europe had been a place of unsatisfied longings before the war—of socialists hoping for a better world, of labor for better conditions, of nationalists for their own homes—and those longings emerged again with greater force because in the fluid world of 1919 it was possible to dream of great change—or have nightmares about the collapse of order./

  /It is hard today to imagine that such a project could have been taken seriously. Only a handful of eccentric historians still bother to study the League of Nations. Its archives, with their wealth of materials, are largely unvisited. Its very name evokes images of earnest bureaucrats, fuzzy liberal supporters, futile resolutions, unproductive fact-finding missions and, above all, failure: Manchuria in 1931, Ethiopia in 1935 and, most catastrophic of all, the outbreak of the Second World War a mere twenty years after the first one had ended./
#+end_quote

- The "best" legacy of the League of Nations is its form as an experiment. It failed, but it was through the failure that the much stronger United Nations rose from.
- Part of Wilson's idealism is his belief that the League would grow to be a dynamic and healthy platform for mutual respect and communication among nations, whatever their differences may be. This is also why he left much of his design for the League vague and ambiguous.
- This, however, became part of its problem, as there were much confusion as to what role it should take and what methods it should utilize in resolving disputes and enforcing international rules.
- Lord Robert Cecil and General Jan Smuts both saw the benefit of the League in protecting the British Empire, so they eagerly helped out in ironing its specifics. Wilson liked both men, so he agreed to their assistance.
- French proposal to set up a League army and enforce mandatory arbitration was turned down by both US and Britain. They saw it as French excuse to further pin down Germany. The US also didn't want to be dictated upon on issues of foreign intervention.
- Another major failing of the League was, because of Great Power fears of being overriden by the "lesser" nations, they insisted on unanimity on certain situations. This significantly crippled the League's powers to enforce its terms.
- Mandates were proposed as a way to manage territories without directly colonizing or annexing them. Either European powers or the League itself can take charge of administering a mandate, until such time that its natives are able to govern themselves.
- Yugoslavia was already in existence when the Paris Conference began. The delegation is composed of the various nationalities in the newly created state, headed by Serbia's former prime minister, Nicola Pašić.

  /To all the Balkan nations, the disappearance of Austria-Hungary was as exhilarating an opportunity as the defeats of the Ottoman empire before the war. Each wanted as much as it could get: self-determination for itself but not for its neighbors. Already during that confused period in October 1918 when Austria-Hungary sued for peace and then vanished from history, Balkan governments had started to stake out possession, moving their armies in. New bodies popped up like mushrooms after a storm: workers’ councils, soldiers’ councils, councils of Croats, Macedonians, Greeks. It was not clear who was behind them, but there seemed no end to them and no limit to their demands./

- Rumania came into the war when they thought the situation fortuitous, in 1916 as the Allies were gaining ground. But once the situation reversed, Rumania ended up being overrun by the Central Powers.
- In 1918, Rumania struck a deal with the Central Powers and dropped out of the conflict, much to the Allies' annoyance. Funny enough, to make sure they can keep the deals made with the Allies, Rumania again declared war on Germany a day before the armistice was signed.

The Soviets also took about half of the Bukovina in the north, and the Bulgarians took back part of the disputed Dobrudja in the south. But Rumania still holds its greatest gain: Transylvania./

- Disarmament of German Army was considered paramount to lasting peace. But the delegates couldn't agree on the specifics. Ferdinand Foch was tasked to provide recommendations. But both Lloyd George and Clemenceau didn't trust Foch enough and ended up compromising on the disarmament.
- France insisted on securing the Rhineland, with internal disagreements on the form and method. Wilson wanted the issue to be resolved by the League and not unilaterally by the French.
- Ultimately, the terms for German disarmament were approved, after being used as bargaining chip with Wilson in exchange for the League's covenant. Germany was to be left with an army that's marginally more miltiaraized than a police force.

* RUSSIA'S WAR
** /Richard Overy/

#+begin_quote
  /It is difficult to write the history of the war without recognizing that some idea of a Russian 'soul' or 'spirit' mattered too much to ordinary people to be written off as mere sentimentality, however mundane or banal or brutalizing was the real day-to-day experience of war./

- In the 1920s, Germany and the Soviet Union formed a military collaboration. For the Soviet Union, it was meant to introduce western military technologies to the Soviet Army. And for Germany, they primarily positioned military training and production within the Soviet territory in order to evade Versailles restrictions on rearmament.
- In 1939, Stalin initiated talks with Britain and France for a defense pact against Nazi Germany. The Western nations were lukewarm on the offer. They also had different expectations for the alliance; the West wants a diplomatic deterrent against Hitler, but the Soviet Union wants an actual war coalition to fight Germany head-on.
- The offer for alliance fell apart when the Soviets realized how little the West's military preparations were, not to mention how unwilling Britain and France are to match Soviet military strength. At around this same time, Germany began reaching out to the Soviet Union for a possible non-aggression pact, which  ultimately became the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.



* THE END OF EMPIRES AND A WORLD REMADE
** /Martin Thomas/

- Main argument: Decolonization is a "globally connected process".
- The end of empires, and globalization, are codependent with each other.n
- The idea of decolonization is framed on Western imperialist terms. Independence movements inadvertently campaigned for self-governance, but with the same hierarchical system imposed by the colonizers.
- Imperial protectionism worsened the effects of the Depression especially in the colonial territories. Most colonies experienced famine in the 1930s due to such policies.
- Overlaps in language and ideology of anticolonialism and communism enabled the mixture of both, and indeed postwar anticolonial movements and figures are often Marxists too. The structure and methods of communist organizations also became crucial in spreading the idea of decolonization.
- The Nazi regime and anticolonial movements found a common cause in opposing the allied empires. They had loose alliances of convenience during the War.
- Author endorses the concept of a greater Second World War.
- I like how it elaborated on the postwar Huk rebellion in the Philippines. I didn't expect the author to devote a couple of paragraphs on the topic, and it's a concise and fair treatment too.
- Postwar decolonization violence was fueled by both war-related economic hardships and general anticolonial sentiment.
- The British Empire distrusted the un, and resolved to hold on to their territories despite wave of anticolonial movements.
- The British envisioned a Malayan union, but was faced with opposition from various ethnic groups. Ethnic Malays did not want a union with migrant groups. Indians and Chinese, especially in Singapore, faced greater hardship during the war than ethnic Malays, causing animosity with the Malay and the British.
- War-related hardships endured by the ethnic Chinese pushed them into communist movements. This, in turn, gave the British a cause to demonize them, claiming that the Chinese are bringing in a foreign anomaly (communism) into Malaya, thereby further fueling ethnic Malay hatred towards the Chinese population.
- The author contends that partition is direct consequence of decolonization.
- In Kenya, British colonialists promoted the image of underground protest movements as being related to satanic activities and witchcraft.
- Decolonization in Southern Africa was spearheaded not by the black African majority, but by the white minority that insists on apartheid policy despite widespread opposition locally and globally.
- France tried to hide the severity of its war in Algeria by means of social policies, but ultimately the truth of the violence flooded global consciousness and made it impossible to prevent Algerian call for independence.
- Colonial mindset seeped through even in national branches of international organizations. the French Red Cross secretly refused to channel aid to Algerians.
- Colonial technocrats imposed Western standards of development onto the colonies, without regard for local customs and practices. this is in line with the arguments presented in James Scott's Seeing Like a State.
- Damages caused by large scale colonial development - especially environmental and agricultural damages - greatly amplified anticolonial sentiment
- The Bretton Woods system poured money into the decolonizing countries, and promoted global free trade, mostly to the advantage of richer countries.

  /Imperialism’s transcontinental presence lent opposition to empire, whether wholeheartedly anticolonial or not, an equally global character. From African American civil rights workers and other political campaigners within the Black Atlantic to medical humanitarians and civil society networks in the communist ‘Second World’ and on to refugee groups and student activists from Palestine to Vietnam, opposition to white supremacy, imperialism, and settler colonialism forged connections that gave decolonization a singular aspect as a global fight against the injustice intrinsic to colonialism./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In the imperial rhetoric of decolonization’s wars, restoring order meant the resumption of whatever sociopolitical plans, economic projects, or other modernization schemes were interrupted by conﬂict. The priority was to limit the fallout from the exposure of rights abuses, not to question the actions that produced them as counterinsurgency drives unfolded. The logic of ‘order before reform’ was trotted out as stock justifcation for late colonial counterinsurgency until global audiences refused to believe it. But imperial powers felt less need to defend the legal arrangements and security apparatus intrinsic to colonies’ violent liminal condition at other times. Instead, the everyday violence of colonialism was just that: a normative standard with supposedly structural causes rather than a massive agglomeration of civilian maltreatment./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Sometimes the actions of insurgents and counterinsurgents are better understood as a bargaining process in which those involved tried to secure additional inﬂuence over government. Temporary alliances and local deals cut across supposedly binary divides between imperial security forces and insurgents. From Malaya to Algeria, defiance by rebels of a leadership ‘line’, oﬀers of money to fghters willing to surrender, and even changing sides were sufciently commonplace to be integrated into security force strategy. Viewed in this light, the job of colonial security forces was not to defeat insurgents outright but to restrict dissent to levels that enabled administration and economic activity to continue./

  /Patterns of protest in newly independent nations were remarkably similar in the decades after independence, with food riots, demonstrations by excluded ethnic minorities, and demands for the fulfllment of decolonization pledges predominating as causes of social unrest. At a deeper level, the distribution of political power in numerous former colonial dependencies could be characterized as variants of state capitalism. For all the leftist leanings of erstwhile anticolonial movements that took ofce after the withdrawal of European rulers, few governments in postcolonial nations sustained early commitments to redistribution. Many proved equally unwilling to invest in more social-democratic alternatives of a mixed economy built around a private sector whose growth would be encouraged by selective governmental support. Instead, the Cold War returned to Africa with a vengeance in the 1970s and 1980s, heightened superpower interventionism manifested in proxy wars and deteriorating standards of governance./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Anticolonialism makes sense as a unifying abstraction, an expression of opposition to something ethically indefensible, rather than as unswerving support for a particular national form. The idea that, one after another, colonies would become nations ignores the multiplicity of viewpoints and the alternatives in play. Imperial and nationalist conceptions of bounded sovereignty jarred with the pluralistic arrangements and local improvisations that had enabled empires to survive despite the weakness of their structures and the porousness of their borderlands. Transnational connections, cosmopolitan inﬂuences, and diﬀering layers of attachment to kin, community, faith, and locality were everywhere diferent, yet always the same in exposing the myth of nationalism triumphant./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Imperialist thinking shaped ideas about how sovereign statehood should be constituted and when independent nations should be recognized. Its traces were evident in everything from the constitutional plans of late colonial reformists and the calamities of partition to the developmental projects and human rights discourses promoted by supranational agencies and NGOs in the 1960s and beyond. The decolonizing world was assigned junior status within this global political geography, its elevation to full integration dependent on foreign-led modernization, capital investment, and technology transfer./

  /Although Africa is a continent of great diversity, African states have much in common, not only their origins as colonial territories, but the similar hazards and difficulties they have faced.

- Well into the 20th century, until postwar period, much of African colonies were governed by just a few hundred colonial administrators.
- 6 March 1957, Ghana formally became an independent republic. Its first prime minister, Kwame Nkrumah, was a self-proclaimed Marxist Socialist who overwhelmingly won the election while imprisoned for sedition.
- Gamal Abdel Nasser's 1952 coup successfully ended the 140-year rule of the Alawiyya dynasty. King Farouk was forced to abdicate and exiled to Europe. Naseer's Free Officers took the helm, marking the first time in 2500 years that Egypt is ruled by a native Egyptian.

  /After 124 years of/ la présence française /in Algeria, French colons – or /pieds noirs, /as they were called – had achieved a total grip on political power, commerce, agriculture and employment, effectively relegating the majority Muslim population – Arab and Kabyle – to a subservient status and stubbornly resisting all attempts at change./

  /In the turbulent postwar era, as a succession of French governments struggled to survive amid strikes, inflation, austerity and a debilitating war in Indo-China, none was willing to risk antagonising the pied noir population and their supporters for the sake of reform in Algeria.

- Anti-French guerilla operations began in 1947, and gradually intensified over the years. A failed operation against French police and military infrastructure in 1954 lead to increasingly violent and indiscriminate reprisals against the Muslim population.
- By 1955, the insurgency became a full-blown conflict, as the FLN began mass attacks against the white civilians. It reached even higher escalation in 1956 when the French government authorized conscription and called up reservists to quell the Algerian nationalist movement.
- As the conflict dragged on, metropolitan France was plagued by economic hardships, which lead to successive governments collapsing and long periods without one. The military became increasingly agitated, and boiled over in May 1958 with the murder of French conscripts in Algeria.
- With massive clamor from both military and the /pied noirs/ in Algeria, the wartime leader General Charles de Gaulle was swept into power and granted unprecedented powers to rule by decree.

  /In the postcolonial era,/ l’Afrique Noire /was regarded as part of France’s/ chasse gardée /– a private estate, jealously guarded against encroachment by other world powers. Indeed, the changes that occurred were largely ceremonial. In place of a French-controlled administration, the new states were now run by elite groups long accustomed to collaborating with the French and well attuned to French systems of management and culture. Though popularly elected, they were separated by a wide social and cultural gulf from the mass of the population. Their ambitions lay more in accumulating positions of power, wealth and status, more in developing a high bourgeoisie, than in transforming society./

- Throughout the British colonies in Africa there was a sense that independence is much preferable than all the troubles of trying to mainin fragile colonial links, including nationalist groups aligning to Soviet communism.

- From the moment it gained independence, arguably even before, Congo has been mired in political bickering and public chaos.
- A mutiny caused split in the leadership. Patrice Lumumba became convinced that Belgium wanted to take back control of Congo. He appointed his personal aide, Joseph Mobutu, to help stamp the mutiny.
- Getting increasingly agitated, Lumuba first turned against the Belgians, then the UN, and ultimately asked for assistance from the Soviet Union.
- Lumumba may have genuinely feared the possibilities of further chaos and even invasion at the time. Still, he managed to appear vindictive, irrational, and even dangerous, to so many parties involved. They all privately agreed on one conclusion: Lumumba has to be eliminated.
- The CIA was indeed involved in the planning of the assasination, with the blessing of Eisenhower himself.
- Lumumba was arrested and thrown into the hands of the secessionist government in Katanga, assisted by Belgian armed personnel. He and his companions were beaten and tortured, then brought to a secluded outside Katanga.
- On the night of 17 January 1961, Patrice Lumumba and two others were shot by a firing squad led by a Belgian officer. They were buried in a prepared grave, but later their remains were dug up and disposed of elsewhere.
- The chaos further worsened, now coupled with international condemnation of Lumumba's death. In 1965, Joseph Mobutu staged a coup and declared himself president.

  /In 1948 Afrikaner Nationalists came to power  their own version of racial rule they called apartheid, determined to ensure white supremacy for all time and to destroy the swart gevaar, the black peril they said white society faced. Stage by stage, the black population was subjected to a vast array of government controls and segregated from whites wherever possible. Every facet of their life – residence, employment, education, public amenities and politics – was regulated to keep them in a strictly subordinate role.

- In 1961, the failure of a national strike led Mandela to consider using violence against the apartheid regime. He formed a splinter group that engaged in sabotage activities, though their works were too small-scale and amateurish to cause significant disturbance.

African leaders, riding the crest of popularity, stepped forward with energy and enthusiasm to tackle the tasks of development and nation-building; ambitious plans were launched; bright young men went quickly to the top.

- African independence sentiments were aided by the fortunate circumstances prevailing at the time. African economies were in upward movement, harvests were bountiful throughout the 1950s, and interest in African studies all over the world was very high, following the discovery of the oldest hominids in Olduvai Gorge in Tanganyika in 1959.
- Nationalist leaders like Kwame Nkrumah opted for an African brand of socialism, positing it as antidote to Western colonialism. They were also influenced by the success of left-leaning European governments in establishing welfare states after WW2.
- Both the Soviet Union and China showed active interest in supporting revolutionary movements in Africa. The Soviet Union supplied arms and money to rebel groups, while Cuba recruited the Argentinian guerilla leader Che Guevara to train African rebels.

  /Political systems too were recent transplants. Africans had little experience of representative democracy – representative institutions were introduced by the British and the French too late to alter the established character of the colonial state.

  /The most difficult task facing Africa’s new leaders was to weld into nations a variety of different peoples, speaking different languages and at different stages of political and social development. The new states of Africa were not ‘nations’. They possessed no ethnic, class or ideological cement to hold them together, no strong historical and social identities upon which to build. For a relatively brief period, the anti-colonial cause had provided a unity of purpose.

- Africans tended to stick with communities of their own ethnic groups, especially when migrating to towns and cities.

Trade unions and farmers’ organisations were subordinated to the interests of government. The press existed merely as an outlet for government propaganda.

  /It was often said that, because of the internal tensions and rivalries afflicting most African states, only strong government could provide the stability they needed to develop and prosper. Yet in practice, strong governments of the kind employed in Africa – whether personal dictatorships or one-party systems – rarely ensured either political stability or effective administration. Once in power, African leaders became preoccupied with staying in power, employing whatever means were necessary./

  /Despite the promising start made at independence in 1960, Nigeria was soon engulfed by an intense struggle between the country’s three main political parties for supremacy over the federal government. Control of the federal government determined the allocation of development resources. Because each region produced its own political party dominated by the major ethnic group based there, the struggle turned into ethnic combat. Politicians on all sides whipped up ethnic fear, suspicion and jealousy for their own advantage and to entrench themselves in power. Tribalism became the ideology of politics./

- Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe, in 1966, released A Man of the People, which tells of an African leader's reign that ends in an army coup. Coincidentally, that same week a coup overthrew the Northern-led government of Nigeria.
- The chaos of 1966 fueled the secession of Biafra the following year. It garnered worldwide attention and received large scale relief aid. The international support, however, was not enough to save Biafra, and in 1970 the embattled republic surrendered.
- When Eritrea was relinquished by Britain in the 1950s, UN placed the country in a federation with the Kingdom of Ethiopia. Gradually Ethiopia stripped Eritrea of its autonomous rights, and subsumed the Eritreans into the Kingdom.
- The emperor, Haile Selassie, ruled with an iron fist, suppressing dissent and demanding submission from his subjects.

  /Whatever their real reasons for seizing power, coup leaders invariably stressed the strictly temporary nature of military rule.

  /By the 1980s a mood of despair about Africa had taken hold. No other area of the world aroused such a sense of foreboding. The sum of its misfortunes was truly daunting. In relentless succession, African states had succumbed to military coups and brutal dictatorships, to periods of great violence and to economic decline and decay. One by one, African leaders had failed to deliver effective programmes to alleviate the plight of their populations. The vast majority of Africans enjoyed neither political rights nor freedoms. More than two-thirds were estimated to live in conditions of extreme poverty. The future was spoken of only in pessimistic terms./

- Ethiopia's dictator, Colonel Mengistu, deliberately ignored and covered up the worsening conditions in the northern part of the country. In 1984, the situation has devolved into a famine, which became so widespread that the dictatorship was no longer able to hide it from the world.
- The 1984-1985 Ethiopian famine led to the largest peacetime humanitarian mission in the 20th century. At least one million died in the famine, with likely even more undocumented.
- Throughout Africa, AIDS continued to spread and killed tens of thousands. Two countries, Uganda and Senegal, initiated public programs to counter the epidemic. But elsewhere, the dictators of Africa willingly covered up the extent of the AIDS epidemic, even blaming it on the West.

  /So steep was Africa’s economic decline during the 1980s that it became known as ‘the lost decade’. In one country after another, living standards plummeted. By the mid-1980s most Africans were as poor or poorer than they had been at the time of independence. Crippled by debt, mismanagement and a collapse in tax revenues, African governments could no longer afford to maintain proper public services. Roads, railways, water, power and telephone systems deteriorated; schools, universities and hospitals were starved of funds; scientific facilities and statistical offices became early casualties. At every level the capacity of governments to function was fast diminishing. A drastic erosion of civil service salaries wrecked what was left of the morale, honesty and efficiency of civil servants./

  /Whereas in the 1960s Western development economists had advocated that the state should act as the motor of development and dismissed the role of markets, in the 1980s they regarded the state as a principal cause of development failure and called for market-oriented development strategies in place of government intervention. Where once they had encouraged state ownership, now they sought to enhance the scope of the private sector, contending that private enterprise was more effective./

- One major problem with the donor programs for Africa was that the reforms weren't closely watched and monitored by international organizations. The dictators quickly realized they were receiving aid with practically no consequence, so they just kept on with their old corrupt ways.

  /Africa, by the end of the 1980s, was renowned for its Big Men, dictators who strutted the stage, tolerating neither opposition nor dissent, rigging elections, emasculating the courts, cowing the press, stifling the universities, demanding abject servility and making themselves exceedingly rich. Their faces appeared on currency notes; their photographs graced offices and shops. They named highways, football stadiums and hospitals after themselves.

- South Africa's political and economic stability in the 1960s made the apartheid regime more convinced of its own success and righteousness.

  /While the outside world had expected Mandela to dwell on the suffering he and his colleagues had endured in prison, he himself was more interested in explaining what they had learned there, the understanding they had gained, the reasons for their lack of bitterness, the strength of their commitment to democracy that had sustained them. No matter what personal hardship he had undergone, he was determined never to lose sight of the goal of non-racial democracy, believing that white fear of it could eventually be overcome. The example he set was of profound importance. For if after twenty-seven years in prison, Mandela could emerge insisting on reconciliation, it undermined the demands of those seeking revenge and retribution. His generosity of spirit also had a profound impact on his white adversaries, earning him measures of trust and confidence that laid the foundations for a political settlement./

- Since the 1960s there has been growing radical movements within the Islamic world. In Egypt figures like Sayyid Qutb and Sheikh Omar Adbel Rahman promoted the use of jihad against un-Islamic ideologies and practices, including those of Muslim leaders.

  /For as long as the goal of a ‘Greater Somalia’ seemed attainable, clan rivalries were held in check. But when the government’s irredentist campaign ended in a humiliating military defeat, it set in motion an implosion of the Somali state.

#+end_quote  

- Somali society is based on clan-families, and Somali people owe their allegiance mainly to their immediate blood kin.
- Somalia initially aligned with the Soviet Union, then with their support sought to expand to territories the Somali believe to be theirs. But Soviet Union later switched sides, supporting Ethiopia.
- Defeat in the war with Ethiopia intensified the clan rivalries. Dictator Siyad Barre used the usual strongman tactics to keep control, but the situation gradually devolved into factional conflicts, egged on by Ethiopia's Mengistu.
- By the 1990s, the government in Mogadishu has lost practical control of the whole country. The situation has gotten so bad that even international organizations like UN could no longer perform their functions and had to evacuate.
- UN returned in 1992, but had very little resources to make significant help for Somalia.
- The US became more involved in the UN operations. Initially, they sought to restore order without resorting to violence. To an extent they managed to do so, but had to broker deals with local factions, and forego opportunities to disarm militias.
- When the UN sought to further extend control over Somalia, the US involvement became more active, and unwittingly lopsided against a specific faction.
- A failed operation in 1993 to capture militia leader Aideed saw the US elite troops trapped and surrounded by hundreds of milita, with some of their Black Hawk choppers being shot down. The debacle tarnished US operations in Somalia, which President Clinton terminated.
- Once US pulled out, other countries also felt they have no need to cooperate with UN peacekeeping operations in Somalia. The whole UN involvement in the country has fallen apart.
- Clinton modified US policy on UN peacekeeping missions, providing for clear and strict preconditions such as well-defined scope, effective ceasefire plans, and proper exit strategies. Most of all, the operations must serve vital national interests.

  /Ever since the idea of Hutu hegemony had taken hold during the 1950s, Hutu politicians had portrayed the Tutsi minority as an ‘enemy’ seeking to reimpose their rule over Rwanda. A key part of the ideology they constructed was the myth that the Tutsi were invaders who had overrun Rwanda in the pre-colonial era and enslaved the Hutu – an alien group, therefore, that had no legitimate status in the country./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In the early 1990s, when the ruling Hutu clique faced growing political opposition, they sought to maintain their hold on power by rousing Hutu against the Tutsi threat, fomenting a climate of fear and hatred, relying on the Hutu’s culture of obedience to ensure their orders were obeyed and preparing for the onslaught well in advance by arming militias and organising death squads. The genocide that followed was caused not by ancient ethnic antagonism but by a fanatical elite engaged in a modern struggle for power and wealth using ethnic antagonism as their principal weapon. Though Western governments knew that massive killing was underway, they failed to take the steps needed to prevent it. The result was slaughter on a scale not witnessed since the Nazi extermination programme against the Jews./

- Mandela's presidency was marked by careful compromises and cautious approach to South Africa's various problems.
- His Truth and Reconciliation Committee, created to provide accountability for apartheid-era human rights violations, itself ended with compromise: both apartheid government and the ANC were found to be guilty of various crimes, but also extended amnesty rather than criminal prosecution to those who admitted guilt.
- Mandela's successor, Thabo Mbeki, despite winning with an even larger margin, proved to be more controversial as a leader. He promoted AIDS misinformation which further worsened the epidemic in South Africa. He was also soft in dealing with Mugabe, and did not publicly criticize him.

#+begin_quote
  /Mbeki’s determination to back a brutal African dictator, rather than stand up for human rights, followed a long tradition by leaders in Africa of turning a blind eye to the nefarious activities of their peers for the sake of group solidarity. It won him support in Africanist circles in South Africa who celebrated Zimbabwe’s example of giving the whites a good kicking and hoped for something similar in South Africa. But it caused apprehension among foreign investors, nervousness among the white population and aroused further misgivings about Mbeki’s commitment to democratic values. Moreover, it sullied the reputation of the ANC, which had received so much help in its own struggle for human rights and now remained indifferent to the struggle that others in the neighbourhood faced./

  /Within a few brief years of the advent of democracy, therefore, South Africa’s image as a beacon of hope for the continent had been severely tarnished.

#+begin_quote
  /The First, unlike the Second World War, saw no systematic displacement of populations, no deliberate starvation, no expropriation, little massacre or atrocity. It was, despite the efforts by state propaganda machines to prove otherwise, and the cruelties of the battlefield apart, a curiously civilised war./

  /Yet it damaged civilisation, the rational and liberal civilisation of the European enlightenment, permanently for the worse and, through the damage done, world civilisation also. Pre-war Europe, imperial though it was in its relations with most of the world beyond the continent, offered respect to the principles of constitutionalism, the rule of law and representative government. Post-war Europe rapidly relinquished nconfidence in such principles./

#+begin_quote
  /There was, admittedly, a fear of war in the abstract, but it was as vague as the perception of what form modern war itself might take.

  /All European armies in 1904 had long-laid military plans, notable in most cases for their inflexibility. None was integrated with what today would be called a ‘national security policy’, made in conclave between politicians, diplomats, intelligence directors and service chiefs, and designed to serve a country’s vital interests, for such a concept of national leadership did not then exist. Military plans were held to be military secrets in the strictest sense, secret to the planners alone, scarcely communicable in peacetime to civilian heads of government, often not from one service to another./

  /The ‘Schlieffen Plan’, so-called after its architect, was the most important government document written in any country in the first decade of the twentieth century; it might be argued that it was to prove the most important official document of the last hundred years, for what it caused to ensue on the field of battle, the hopes it inspired, the hopes it dashed, were to have consequences that persist to this day./
#+end_quote

- The Schlieffen Plan, ambitious and well-crafted as it was, ultimately remained deeply flawed until its implementation. Until the end of his life, Schlieffen agonized with how to transport all the troops needed for a lightning victory, in a short period of time, within the cramped space between northern France and Germany.
- Author notes that full details of Serbian govenrment's involvement in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand II is not established. I think The Sleepwalkers does show how closely connected it is. Nevertheless, Austria-Hungary let its inherent suspicion (or hatred) of Serbia to frame its judgment on how to respond.
- The author is of the opinion that had Austria-Hungary retaliated immediately, the rest of Europe would have tolerated it at the minimum. The argument hinges on an immediate attack not being reliant on Germany's tacit support, which would've triggered certain alliances and treaties.

Modern communication systems may overload those who seek to be informed through them, so consuming time necessary for thought; underload, in 1914, consumed time as men puzzled to fill in the gaps between the facts they had.

  /At the outset, the advantage lay with the attackers, as long as they could preserve a measure of secrecy, a diminishing possibility as the war prolonged and defenders learnt how greatly survival depended upon surveillance and alertness. Almost as soon as the attackers entered the enemy’s positions, however, the advantage tended to move towards the defenders, who knew the ground, which the attackers did not, had prepared fall-back positions, and were retreating towards their own artillery along, if lucky, intact telephone lines. The attackers found themselves in exactly the opposite situation, moving into unknown and confusing surroundings, and away from their supporting artillery the further they advanced, thus progressively losing contact with it as telephone lines were broken or left behind. Then, when the defenders counter-attacked, the advantage reversed. The attackers had familiarised themselves with the ground taken, organised its defences, to their advantage but the enemy’s confusion, and re-established telephonic communication with their artillery. In this see-saw, functional and structural weaknesses disfavoured first one side, then the other, to the eventual frustration of all effort to break through to open country or break back to the original line of defence.

Joffre’s two-hour lunch, Hindenburg’s ten-hour night, Haig’s therapeutic daily equitation along roads sanded lest his horse slip, the Stavka’s diet of champagne and court gossip, seem and were a world away from the cold rations, wet boots, sodden uniforms, flooded trenches, ruined billets and plague of lice on, in and among which, in winter at least, their subordinates lived./

- Three counterarguments to criticism of First World War generals:
  - Contrary to popular belief, the generals were themselves exposed to danger from time to time. In fact, dozens of generals were killed during the War.
  - A headquarters far from the battlefield is much better as vantage point for commanding the vast armies of the War.
  - Communications systems in the First World War were slow and inefficient, and dependent on infrastructure directly on the line of fire, hence dangerous to set up and maintain.

#+begin_quote
  /Most of the accusations laid against the generals of the Great War – incompetence and incomprehension foremost among them – may therefore be seen to be misplaced. The generals, once those truly incompetent, uncomprehending and physically or emotionally unfit had been discarded, which they were at the outset, came in the main to understand the war’s nature and to apply solutions as rational as was possible within the means to hand. Robbed of the ability to communicate once action was joined, they sought to overcome the obstacles and accidents that would inevitably arise in the unfolding of battle by ever more elaborate anticipation and predisposition. Plans were drawn which laid down minute-by-minute manoeuvre by the infantry and almost yard-by-yard concentration of artillery fire, in an attempt not so much to determine as to predestine the outcome. The attempt was, of course, vain. Nothing in human affairs is predestinable, least of all in an exchange of energy as fluid and dynamic as a battle. While battle-altering resources – reliable armoured, cross-country vehicles, portable two-way radio – lay beyond their grasp (and they did so, tantalisingly, only in a development time to be measured in a few years), the generals were trapped within the iron fetters of a technology all too adequate for mass destruction of life but quite inadequate to restore to them the flexibilities of control that would have kept destruction of life within bearable limits./

* THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH
** /Richard Dawkins/

- Theory has two clashing definitions: system of statements considered as facts; and hypothesis yet to be conclusively proven. Evolution is a theory in the first sense of the word. However, the second sense is what theory is commonly defined as. This is used as ammo by anti-evolution crowd in discrediting the concept.
- Facts are proven differently in science and in math. The process of proving in mathematics is much more rigorous and demonstrable.

#+begin_quote
  /Proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The fact that some widely held past beliefs have been conclusively proved erroneous doesn’t mean we have to fear that future evidence will always show our present beliefs to be wrong. How vulnerable our present beliefs are depends, among other things, on how strong the evidence for them is./

- There is more than sufficient evidence for evolution even without fossil record. The presence or absence of such is largely irrelevant to the theory of evolution. The discovery of fossil is mostly just a bonus, and gaps in the fossil record is not enough to disprove evolution.
- This also means that absence of the so-called missing link between primates and humans is not a disproof of evolution. In fact, it's not necessary at all to prove evolution, which is already true with or without such a missing link.

An intermediate dose will kill some, but not all. If there is genetic variation among bacteria, such that some are more susceptible to the antibiotic than others, an intermediate dose will be tailor-made to select in favour of genes for resistance. When the doctor tells you to finish taking the pills, it is to increase the chances of killing all the bacteria and avoid leaving behind resistant, or semi-resistant, mutants./

  /The history of philosophy as it is viewed backwards through the lens of the above enquiries is an essential part of philosophy itself, because all these enquiries have evolved over time as – so to speak – a great conversation among thinkers living in different centuries in different circumstances but nevertheless absorbed in the same fundamental questions; and therefore knowing the ‘case law’ of these debates is crucial to understanding them. This prevents us from unnecessarily reinventing the wheel over and over again, helps us to avoid mistakes and to recognize pitfalls, allows us to profit from our predecessors’ endeavours and insights, and gives us materials to use in trying to understand the subject matter at issue, and to frame the right questions to ask about them./

  /As regards history: if there is no evidence one way or the other for a claim about something that happened in the past, is the claim nevertheless definitely either true or false, or is it neither? History is written in the present on the basis of evidence – diaries, letters, archaeological remains – that has survived into the present (or so we judge): it is partial and fragmentary, and many of the past’s traces are lost; is there therefore such a thing as knowledge of the past at all, or is there only interpretative reconstruction at best – and perhaps, too often, just surmise?/

  /Until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, philosophers did not often enough ask the right questions in the right way about nature; when they did, the natural sciences were thereby born, developing into magnificent and powerful fields of enquiry which brought the modern world into existence. Philosophy thus gave birth to science in those centuries; in the eighteenth century it gave birth to psychology, in the nineteenth century to sociology and empirical linguistics, in the twentieth century it played important roles in the development of artificial intelligence and cognitive science./

  /An oddity of histories of philosophy which include theologians among the philosophers is that there is no better reason to include Christian theologians while excluding Jewish or Islamic ones./

  /A fundamental difference between philosophy and theology is that philosophy is the enterprise of trying to make sense of ourselves and our world in a way which asks what we should think and why, whereas theology is the enterprise of exploring and expounding ideas about a certain kind of thing or things taken to exist actually or possibly, namely, a god or gods – a being or beings supposed to be different in significant and consequential ways from ourselves./

- Oh boy, time to argue with a philosophy book lol.
- I disagree on excluding theology - or in this context, theologians and their works - from the greater history of philosophy. To an extent, I agree with the author that Islamic and Jewish theologies should've been discussed to. But only within the context of how they influenced Western Philosophy.
- See, Christian theology is almost inseparable from Western history, especially in a context that broadly sweeps through that history. Regardless of actual validity of their theological claims, fact is these were what the later philosophers contextualized and argued on.
- Maybe the author will deal with this aspect later in the book. But ultimately, excluding theology is like excluding the ideologies of fascism and communism in a discussion of the Second World War's origins. It excludes the rationale for what follows.

- Doxography is the scholarly field of retrieving, collating, and preserving ancient texts. In this book, it was used in the context of pre-Socratic philosophy works, much of which are already lost.
- Thales is the first to attempt to theorize a fundamental form of life, which for him is water. That is, life comes from water and ends up back into water.

  /A major achievement of the Pythagorean school was its discovery that the pitch of a musical note depends on the length of a string whose vibrations produce the note, and that simple numerical ratios explain the consonant intervals of the scale: 2:1 octave, 3:2 perfect fifth, 4:3 perfect fourth, and so on. To understand this, think of two guitar strings of equal length, tension and thickness. If they are both plucked together they sound the same. If different lengths of each are plucked, they sometimes sound dissonant and sometimes consonant. This latter observation underlies measurement of consonant intervals – an interval being the distance between two notes, and a consonant interval being one in which the two notes sound good together. Experiment will show that if you have two lengths of string of equal length, tension and thickness, plucking one while simultaneously plucking exactly half the length of the other will yield a consonance – this is the octave. If the second string is plucked at two-fifths the length of the first, the resulting consonant is a perfect fifth./

  /Parmenides’ greatest influence, from the point of view of impact on the entire subsequent history of philosophy, was on Plato and the Platonists.

That is a theme which has underwritten an enormous amount of what philosophy and, later, science has achieved./

- Empedocles posited the composition of nature as being a random combination of four elements: earth, air, fire, water.
- Anaxagoras puts forward the composition of nature as being combination of seeds, or /panspermia/. Composition is determined not by presence or absence, but by preponderance, of such seeds.
- He also theorizes the existence of a /nous/ or reason that controls these seeds and how they interact to produce something.

- In the Socratic method, Socrates asks the interlocutor for a definition of a concept. Then he refutes that definition by citing exceptions. The Socratic method usually ends with no satisfactory definitions, and only exclusions.
- A primary takeaway from Socratic philosophy is that knowledge of what is right is necessary, and one has not lived well unless he knows the good from the bad.
- While there are many ways to refute Socrates' teachings. the best lesson from him is the attitude of wanting to pursue knowledge of truth and the virtues.

  /Socrates’ trial and execution were most probably the result of political turmoil in the years after Athens’ defeat in 404 BCE. Socrates was executed in 399, and Plato’s belief that political chaos must inevitably result in tyranny – because a tyrant would step in to restore order, only making matters worse thereby – underlay his view that the state should be run by ‘philosopher-kings’ living in monk-like freedom from the corrupting influences of wealth-seeking and family ties that could warp their judgment./

- While Socrates embraced the inconclusiveness of his inquiries, Plato sought a system where the essential philosophical questions have a more definite answer.
- Plato's philosophy rests in the search for Forms, eternal and unchanging Truths that cannot be perceived merely by senses. We can be acquainted to these Forms, in the sense that "I know X as explained by someone to me" but it is insufficient. The goal of human knowledge is to fully know the Forms.
- Aristotle took his teacher Plato's desire for systematic philosophy even further, and produced a body of works that delve in a more diverse range of subjects, sometimes refuting Plato's works.
- The works of Aristotle we have now are actually from his lectures, and so can be rather rough to read and understand. He had actual published and polished works, which unfortunately did not survive.
- Despite the coincidence that two towering figures of antiquity - Aristotle and his student, Alexander the Great - have such close relations, considering his later life it's unlikely that Aristotle had discernible positive influence on Alexander.

  /Aristotle’s investigation of how such classes relate to each other as representable in these ways gave him the concept of a classification into genus, species, difference, property and accident. These are the ‘five words’ (quinque voces) as later logicians called them, and they list the ways in which a predicate can relate to a subject – or, alternatively put, the ways in which we can speak about something. You can speak about something specifically, or generally; that is species and genus. You can talk about the differences between species of things that separate them from each other; that is difference. You can talk about the characteristics of something that are found in all instances of the class of things it belongs to – these are properties. Or you can speak of a characteristic that something happens to have but which it could just as likely not have – which it has accidentally, so to speak; these are accidents, like the shape of a shoe or the colour of a shirt./

  /Aristotle identified four ‘causes’: material, efficient, formal and final. Suppose you wish to explain what a table is. You cite the material cause (the wood from which it is made), the efficient cause (the carpenter’s work that brought it into being), the formal cause (the form of the thing; the pattern or design that the carpenter followed in making the table) and the final cause (the end, aim or purpose for which the table was made). When you have given all four causes you have given an explanation. Of these the most important is the final cause, the purpose or aim – the telos. Explanations given in terms of final causes are called teleological explanations./

It thinks about the highest thing there is, which is thought; hence it is pure thought thinking about itself. To this he gives the name God./

- Cynicism emphasized a life of virtue, and acting according to nature. This meant rejecting conventional lifestyle and living simple, even becoming hermit. Diogenes practiced Cynicism in its most extreme form.
- Epicurus' atomism goes beyond that of Democritus'. He posits that while atoms are indivisible, they are not the /minima/, and atoms have components that cannot be separated from the whole.
- He then notes that everything that exists is due to various configurations of such atoms. For Epicurus, everything is material, even the soul, and they are all made up of atoms.
- The view of Epicureanism as being about extravagance and worldly pleasure is a massive misunderstanding of his theories. On the contrary, Epicurus notes that true pleasure derives from simplicity, as it rejects unnecessary complexities that also entail more hardships.
- Stoicism, as defined by its founder Zeno, is a moderate version of Cynicism.
- Stoicism subscribes to the concept of bivalence: something is either true or false, but not both, and no other options.

  /The fundamental Stoic idea in ethics is that happiness – which they agreed is the end or goal,/ telos, /of life – consists in ‘living in accordance with nature’.

They held that the cause of anything must contain at least as much and typically more ‘reality’ than its effect, in order to have sufficient causal potency to bring the effect about; and therefore the cause of the universe must be as real or more real than the universe itself./

- The main reason that philosophy was subordinated to theology in the Middle Ages is because education became a monopoly of the Church.

- Author makes this rather curious note that the only Renaissance philosopher with lasting legacy is Machiavelli. The reasoning is that, other Renaissance thinkers are not known for their philosophical works, but on works that are categorized as something else.

- Aquinas' /Summa Contra Gentiles/ was meant to be a guidebook for disputating and converitng pagans. As such, almsot 3/4 of the book relies of natural theology, with no references to the Scriptures. Only in the last part of the book does Aquinas introduce Catholicism.
- His treatment of Aquinas is much more fair than others.
- Apart from his scientific achievements, Roger Bacon also dabbled in philocophy. A noteworthy legacy of his is treatment of language as signs external to the reality they represent.
- Duns Scotus' philosophy contradicts that of Aquinas in a lot of ways, though likely he didn't specifically target Thomism. Scotus thinks religious truth is only achievable by faith (vs. Aquinas' exalted treatment of reason); he also considers good ness to be the same regardless of whether exhibited by God or by anything else (vs. Aquinas treating God's goodness as divine and above that of others).
- Anselm: ontological
- Aquinas: cosmological, teleological
- Renaissance philosophy, like with its contemporary arts, was move away from the sophisticated and technical, and towards the more practical forms.

- Petrarch's reputation as "Father of Humanism" was less about his own works — which were themselves popular at the time — but from his enthusiastic collation of ancient manuscripts. He enthusiastically encouraged other scholars to discover other such ancient works, which a few did.
- Humanism was primarily an educational movement, aimed at promoting an intellectual upbringing hinged on classical antiquity. It was not meant to run contrary to Church-run education, and in fact went hand-in-hand with it.
- Students of humanism, who were also mainly aristocratic, went on to occupy various government positions, thereby spreading humanist thinking through the political bureaucracy.

  /Renaissance humanists were Christians, at very least in profession and practice, whatever they privately thought, since there was no life outside the religion.

Aristotle had taught that the highest good, the/ summum bonum, /was happiness,/ eudaimonia, /and the Renaissance identified this with eternal life in the presence of God, as promised to the faithful and virtuous as their reward.

- It was the humanistic philosophy of the Renaissance intellectuals that aided the flowering of culture and arts that the period is most known for.
- Humanism itself is not anti-religion. Indeed some of its leading figures like Erasmus were religious. However, humanism also privileged Platonism over Aristotelianism. And this caused some rift with the Church, which privileges Aristotelianism as utilized by Aquinas.
- Machiavelli's political philoosphy relates to the preservation of the state, of which a prince will naturally be most predisposed of.
- In his view, princes do ought to be good leaders and protect their citizens.

And a good prince, above all, should be prepared to use such force to preserve order and stability.

- Hobbes was a royalist, but his political philosophy still works in republican settings. The point for Hobbes is that whatever form the government takes it has to be absolute.

#+begin_quote
  /In the absence of an authority capable of keeping everyone safe, there can be no security; not even self-defence pacts formed by groups of individuals would be sufficient. The only sure source of safety is a ‘common power’, a central authority which Hobbes named ‘Leviathan’, a biblical term denoting a huge monster. The Leviathan’s authority derives from the consent of each member of society to accept its unlimited power over them. The Leviathan could be an individual person, such as a monarch, or a group, or indeed any other entity, so long as it possesses plenary powers./
#+end_quote

- A crucial question in the idea of an absolute Leviathan is obedience: when is it moral to go against or overthrow a sovereign? For Hobbes, most instances of abuse of power do not justify overthrow, and it's self-contradictory as the society would be admitting the failure of its own collective moral conscience.
- On the other hand, the Leviathan has one essential goal, the very reason for its existence: welfare and security of its people. Failure to deliver on this would constitute the only appropriate reason for overthrowing the sovereign.

  /A compelling criticism of Hobbes is offered by Quentin Skinner, who says that Hobbes’ account of liberty undermines a better notion he calls ‘republican liberty’, which is ‘liberty as the absence of dependence’. Free people are those who do not live under any form of arbitrary power, whether or not it is exercised. The view that liberty is merely lack of interference or restraint – or, as Hobbes eventually put it, mere absence of impediment to motion – is insufficient for people to be genuinely free; however benign the existence of power, says Skinner, its mere existence changes free people into slaves. And free people can exist only in a free state./

  - Leibniz proposed that, if everything God does is for the ultimate good, then all the sufferings of the world are also for this ultimate good. With this logic, Leibniz, proposes, we are already in the best and most good world that there could be.

  /So copious was Leibniz’s output, so general his genius and so unfinished and still in development were his philosophical views that it is hard to give a neat summary of them. He is like twentieth-century Analytic philosophers in the detail and technicality of his work; unlike them he sought to build a system out of the technical details; he would have needed more time to see if they could be worked out consistently./

  /Locke had aimed to give a general theory of knowledge: knowledge is about relations of ideas, and contingent or empirical knowledge is effectively probabilistic. Berkeley had offered a metaphysical answer to the epistemological problem: the nature of reality explains how we know, for the substance of reality is mind, and experience consists in having ideas./

#+begin_quote
  /For the entire period between late antiquity and early modern times – which began in the period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, the latter being the century of the Enlightenment’s major flowering – there had been little discussion of ethics outside Christian moral theology, and scarcely any discussion of the underlying principles of ethics. Moral discussion was restricted to interpretation of scripture and Church teaching, and any divergence from orthodox doctrine on these matters was for a long time heavily punished. But the beginning of modern times saw a return to the kind of debate about ethical principles that had flourished in antiquity. The chief reason was the loss of religious authority over what it was permissible to think and discuss, which meant that the moral sceptic’s question, ‘Why should I act in this rather than that way?’ could again be addressed./

- Hume's moral philosophy rejects the rationalist approach, and argues that concept of good (and bad) is based on human nature and not on reason. We can know what is good, but it doesn't make us /want/ to be good.

  /What Rousseau meant by ‘the general will’ is unclear, and is open to being understood in very different ways. The two most common interpretations are, first, that the general will is ‘the will of the people’ as this is understood in the democratic sense of a consensus of everyone agreeing together. The second is a more abstract notion, something like a transcendently conceived common purpose or interest that exists apart from the actual preferences of any given individual. Both interpretations can be backed by what Rousseau writes, though his text seems to favour the second./

#+begin_quote
  /An idea that anticipates Kant’s views is Rousseau’s claim that in civil society people have ‘moral freedom’ because they subject themselves to moral laws that they have imposed on themselves./

  /The idea of civil freedom as obedience to the general will is close to the idea of moral autonomy in the sense that one’s participation in willing the general will in effect makes one a legislator of the laws – including moral laws – under which one lives./

  /Here is a claim that few who are knowledgeable about philosophy would dispute: that the three greatest figures in the history of Western philosophy are Plato, Aristotle and Kant. Other figures have high importance in the story, not least because of the influence they exerted on those who came after them; but there can be little disagreement with the claim that these three names stand above the rest. What marks them out is their intellectual power, their penetration into the deepest parts of difficult questions, and the scope of their contributions. Each created new concepts and vocabularies for exploring the fundamental questions of metaphysics, epistemology and ethics, to say nothing of psychology and social and political theory. Each of them thereby changed and enriched the way nhumankind thinks./

- Kant was a polymath (ok seriously who in this book wasn't lol), and actually had notable contributions in other fields, like the Kant-Laplace mathematical theory.
- empiricism: knowledge comes from perception = a posteriori; observation and experiment.
- rationalism: knowledge comes from reason = a priori; excogitation and inference.

#+begin_quote
  /The ethical outlook advocated by Kant is a ‘deontology’, a rule-based or duty-based ethics. This kind of view is sharply contrasted to any form of ‘consequentialist’ ethics, which evaluates the moral worth of an action by its consequences or outcomes. In deontology an action is moral only insofar as it obeys the rule governing the case, irrespective of outcomes./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Similarly, said Kant, it is necessary to postulate the existence of God to make sense of the idea that virtue will be rewarded. Man is not the cause of nature and he is therefore not able to will that nature should reward those who deserve reward. But the idea of moral law requires that such reward should be possible. Therefore we have to postulate that there is a being capable of ensuring that we nget the rewards we deserve./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The content of Kant’s moral theory is humanistic, in arguing, first, that morality’s most fundamental presupposition is the autonomy of the will, meaning that the will obeys laws it imposes on itself and not those prescribed by an  source such as a deity or sovereign; and secondly that the law such a will thus obeys must be shown to be valid on purely logical grounds. In this respect Kant’s theory is a paradigm of Enlightenment thinking./

#+begin_quote
  /Neither Kant nor his contemporaries thought that they lived in an enlightened age. By ‘enlightenment’ they meant the lessening of darkness, the beginning of the spread of light. The human mind was starting to shrug off the rule of arbitrary authority in the spheres of thought and belief.

- It's interesting to note that the author portrayed Kant as being most influential for his contributions on ethics. Or, in a sense, that Kant's works are notable for the parts that tackle ethics.
- Diderot's /Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers/ was a project to collate Enlightenment thinking and present key concepts and ideas through rigorously written entries.

#+begin_quote
  /The key to the scientific advances of the seventeenth century was the use of observation and reason, experiment and quantification. The key to the eighteenth-century Enlightenment is that it set about applying this same empirical approach to wider regions of thought: to politics, society, education, law and the idea of human rights. When it became clear that empirical enquiry can uncover the secrets of nature, other doctrines – for two prime examples, that of the divine right of kings and the doctrines of theology – began to lose intellectual respectability./
#+end_quote

- The primary significance of the /Encyclopédie/ is that it enabled its reader to learn everything there is to the ideas of the Enlightenment, in a way that isn't hampered by political or religious authorities.
- Enlightenment's opponents are categorized into two: the authorities and masters of status quo, chiefly the conservative political figures and the religious leaders; and the Romantics, who repudiated the Enlightenment's overly quantified and mechanistic view of the world.

  /A history of philosophy in the nineteenth century, and that more general enterprise, a history of ideas in the nineteenth century, differ in this significant respect: that the latter would include accounts of economics and political economy, jurisprudence, Charles Darwin, controversies over evolution and religion, developments in natural science, the beginnings of systematic sociology, philology, anthropology and archaeology, historiography, biblical criticism, and more. It was a century in which the liberating effect of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment on intellectual activity was felt in full./

  /Utilitarianism, whether of Bentham’s or later more elaborate kinds, is a consequentialist theory of morality, understanding moral value in terms only of the outcome of actions, leaving aside any questions about the intentions of agents or the quality of their personal characters. Other theories of morality focus on these two latter, but the distinctive feature of utilitarian theories is that they measure moral value wholly by outcomes./

- Jeremy Bentham was the first to coin the term 'international', which he used to propose the concept of international arbitration.

#+begin_quote
  /Among philosophers the consensus is that Bentham erred in seeking to reduce all human motivation to the desire for pleasure and avoidance of pain just as such, for even if it is right to hold that happiness is the/ summum bonum, /the roads to it are many and varied, and without an account of these – and the conflicts between them – as they arise in human nature a theory premised on the idea is in danger of being too crude./

- Conflicts of ideas have existed throughout history. Early on in his career, GWF Hegel considered philosophy as a means of resolving and harmonizing those conflicts. He looked to classical Greek philosophy as a prime example.
- Later in his life, Hegel would shift his understanding of philosophy to what he became more known for. Conflicts of ideas is what shaped human society; the conflict results in a resolution, which later also receives opposition and causes a new conflict to arise. These conflicts as known as dialectics.
- Hegel believes the Prussia of his time has achieved the culmination of this historical pattern, as the 'Geist' has reached the fulfillment of its dialectical journey.
- The exact meaning of 'Geist' isn't fully known. For the most part, a good approximation seems to be a 'cosmic consciousness'.
- Absolute freedom means absolute knowledge. The culmination of the Geist's journey is the attainment of such absoluteness.
- Hegel's philosophy of history is a teological narrative of the culmination of Geist.

#+begin_quote
  /In Hegel the entire history of the world – as the history of the development of Geist’s increasing self-awareness – is to be understood in terms of the constant evolution of new syntheses out of clashes of opposites./

- A note from the author regarding Hegel:

#+begin_quote
  /I need hardly point out that this account of dialectic, and indeed of Hegel’s views in general as here reported, is abstracted from the obscurity of one of the most impenetrable collections of philosophical texts in the entire canon; they make the fragments of Heraclitus look like Janet and John books./

#+begin_quote
  /Schopenhauer viewed will as a blind force, and its relentless expression of itself, manifesting in human experience as desire, craving, yearning and inevitable dissatisfaction, causes suffering.

- Legal Positivism is the view that a law is valid if it's created by an authority that represents the will of its people, like a Parliament. The law as such is valid regardless of whether its content is moral or not, just or otherwise.

#+begin_quote
  /Mill held that individuals are not accountable to society for things that concern only themselves, and correlatively that society cannot interfere with individuals except when their actions are likely to harm others. Together these commitments entail that individuals should be free unless a good reason exists why they should not be./

- John Stuart Mill was a classical liberal, in the sense that he championed freedom of expression, women's rights, abolition of slavery, and even nonconformity.
- Mill's father was an associate of Bentham the utilitarian. Bentham's philosophy eventually trickled down to the younger Mill, who advocated consequentialism: morality is judged by its consequences.
- Karl Marx, early on in his life, was part of the Young Hegelians who adopted Hegel's dialectic methodology. This dialectic view is foundational to Marx's legacy.
- The context of Marx's famous quote that religion is "the opium of the people" was not merely a direct attack on theism. In his view, religion is what people subscribe to in order to alleviate their suffering. The goal should be to destroy the sources of suffering, which will in turn render the "opium" useless.
  
#+begin_quote
 /An underlying assumption of all Marx’s work is that economic systems up to and including capitalism are unjust and oppressive, and that communism, properly realized, would be a good state of affairs, because it would be premised upon the mutuality of human beings – fellowship, sharing and true freedom. The question whether there are kinds of society that could be just and humanly good without requiring that we wait to see if utopian hopes for human nature can come true remains as the more immediate question requiring answer./

  /Around the name ‘Friedrich Nietzsche’ plays a romance of genius and madness, of profound insight and philosophical revolution. His writings have the vatic character of the Old Testament prophets – deliberately so: his longest book, Thus Spake Zarathustra, is cast in the form of a revelation brought down from the mountains by a seer. It does not impugn the originality and power of Nietzsche’s thought to say that he was a dramatist of ideas as much as a philosopher. Indeed in utterance, in appearance and in biography he is the paradigm of thinker as lightning flash, deliberately shocking those who encounter him, either into outrage or into a different way of thinking./

- Allegations of anti-Semitism against Nietzsche are based on twisted interpretations of his works. His sister, who is anti-Semitic, edited and published his works for malicious goals.
- Ethics is about character, morals is about actions.
- Nietzsche's main thesis throughout his works is the rejection of morals grounded on Judaeo-Christian traditions. That is, all previous responses against theism are themselves also flawed, for they hinge on a reality dominated by Judaeo-Christian morals.
- Despite the impression from even his contemporaries, this author notes that an analysis of Nietzsche's philosophy would conclude that he is in fact /not/ a nihilist.

#+begin_quote
  /Nietzsche insists instead that the will to overcome this frustration, to fight and conquer it so that one can live, create and succeed, is the ethical way. To strive and to desire, to wish to grow and expand, are worthy things; to be one who strives and thereby overcomes the barriers to growth and expansion is to be an Übermensch – ‘Superman’ in the sense of ‘superior man’ – and thus truly moral./

- Idealism grew out of reaction to empiricism. As opposed to empiricist concept of reality as materialist, idealism posits that reality is mental.
- 20th century philiosophy features the division between Analytic and Continental philosophy. The author doesn't go into detail of how exactly to demarcate them.
- But Analytic is somehow more cohesive than Continental. Also, Analytic is mainly Anglophone in origin, as its founder is Bertrand Russell. Continental is more grounded to 19th century German and French philosophies.
- One distinction is that Analytic focuses more on formal logic and goes into detail a lot. Continental has broader themes, and can be more ambiguous and even too academic.
- Russell spent his life vigorously campaigning for progressive values, including women's rights and nuclear disarmament. Interestingly, he was jailed for opposition against the First World War. I don't immediately recall reading about this one.

#+begin_quote
  /A transcendental argument is one that takes something X accepted as being the case, and examines what must also be the case as a condition for X to be the case. It is an argument that works backwards, so to speak, to the necessary conditions of X. A trivial example would be: you are reading these words, so we can know that it is true that you were born and have survived so far, since you could not be reading these words otherwise./

- Logicism asserts that logic is the foundation of (pure) mathematics, and it's a notion that Russell worked on during the development of his work Principia Mathematica.

#+begin_quote
  /Logicism was motivated by the desire to solve two large puzzles about mathematics, one epistemological, the other metaphysical. The epistemological puzzle is: What justifies us in claiming to know mathematical truths such as 1 + 1 = 2? The metaphysical puzzle is, What are the entities or objects referred to in mathematics? The puzzles connect: we would be justified in claiming to know that 1 + 1 = 2 only if we know what ‘1’ and ‘2’ are, together with how we understand ‘+’ and ‘=’./

#+begin_quote
  /The world consists of a plurality of things each possessed of qualities and standing in relations to other things. A description of the world would require to be more than just a list of objects, but an explanation of their qualities and relations too. Things with their qualities and relations are constituents of facts, and facts are expressed by propositions. Propositions which express ‘basic facts’, that is, which simply assert that something has a certain quality or stands in a certain relation to some other thing, Russell called ‘atomic propositions’. When atomic propositions are combined together by means of the logical words ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘if … then …’ they constitute complex or ‘molecular’ propositions. These are exceedingly important because the possibility of inference depends on them. Finally there are ‘general propositions’ such as ‘all men are mortal,’ and they require acceptance of some general principles in addition to the empirical evidence provided by acquaintance with the objects and properties referred to in atomic propositions./

#+begin_quote
  /Russell never thought of himself as a moral philosopher, though he was certainly a moralist – not of a puritanical kind; quite the contrary – but in fact he made genuine contributions to moral theory, anticipating emotivism (the idea that ethical judgments are disguised expressions of how the judger feels about the matter in question) and ‘error theory’ (the view, associated mainly with J. L. Mackie, that because ethical judgments are not objective, they are false)./
#+end_quote

- Though not a moral philosopher, part of Bertrand Russell's enduring legacies are his views on morality.
- Gottlob Frege created a system of formal notation for logic, which Russell later improved on.

#+begin_quote
  /In the process of developing his logic and the ideas necessary for applying it to his chief aim, which was to demonstrate the identity of logic and arithmetic (which is the same as saying: to demonstrate that arithmetic can be reduced to logic, which is analytic), Frege also developed a philosophy of language; and this aspect of his achievement is of equal importance. He arrived at a philosophy of language through the necessity of having to explain reference – how a term refers to objects or concepts – and this in turn required devising a theory of sense, which is – to speak very roughly at this juncture – what one has to know about a term to be able to identify what it refers to./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The richness and technicality of the debate that has sprung from Frege’s work are a testament to its significance. It is another illustration of the fact that, even though the goal of an endeavour might not be reached, the journey undertaken towards it can be very fruitful./

- GE Moore developed the concept of Naturalistic Fallacy, which argues that "goodness" cannto be defined without reference to itself.
- Non-cognitivism is a concept in ethics which states that moral judgments are reflection not of true/false values but of emotional and pyschological inclinations of the individual.

  /As might be guessed from this sketch, Wittgenstein was an unsettled individual, a haunted one – some surmise that it was because of his homosexuality, a persecuted condition in those days, about which he might have suffered guilt. He was also an unsettling one, exercising a powerful hold over students who fell under his spell. His reputation, begun by the admiration of Russell and Moore in his early Cambridge days, confirmed by the difficult and vatic Tractatus, was amplified to the proportions of a cult by his devoted students and epigones, who imitated his way of speaking and gesturing, and treated philosophy as if it were wholly a matter of understanding, agreeing with and expounding Wittgenstein’s views. The spell lasted for a generation after his death, sustained by a series of books made out of his voluminous notes, and by a number of influential followers who carried on interpreting his views and applying his methods./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The fundamental idea in the Tractatus, acquired from Russell, is that language has an underlying structure, inspection of which shows what can be meaningfully said. For Wittgenstein what can be said is the same as what can be thought, so once one has shown what can meaningfully be said, one has shown the limits of thought. Beyond these limits language and thought are meaningless. It is in this outer zone, he argued, that traditional philosophical problems arise, as the result of trying to say the unsayable and think the unthinkable./

  /Through the articles and books by its members, conferences and its journal Erkenntnis the Logical Positivists caught a tide at a significant moment: physics in the first three decades of the twentieth century had made giant strides, and the Positivists’ question – why has philosophy not made progress as science has? (the same question Kant asked in the eighteenth century) – was answered by themselves: because it was still mired in metaphysics, and had not clarified the question of what demarcates genuinely meaningful questions and answers from spurious ones./

  /The Logical Positivism of the Vienna Circle is the view that the only forms of genuine knowledge come from empirical science, from systematically and logically organized examination of natural phenomena.

- A critical concept for Positivism is the verification principle: what is the role of verification in the factual accuracy of a statement?
- Part of the problem is that despite Positivism emphasizing empiricism especially for science, issues with verification arise as general scientific theories and concepts are not always absolutely certain.
- History also takes a hit, with the question of how to verify and establish certainty on the past if it's not something that can be directly observed, and is heavily reliant on evidence both currently present and possibly discoverable in the future.
- Rudolf Carnap attempted to solve this by classifying expressions into observational and theoretical ones. The issue with this is that many scientific statements that might seem observational, upon deeper inspection, are actually very theoretical.
- Karl Popper developed a reverse version of verificationism, called falsificationism. Instead of trying to confirm the truth of a hypothesis, Popper suggested looking for ways to falsify it.
- The issue with verificationism, according to Popper, is that one instinctively works to make a hypothesis valid, making it circular. With falsificationism, the hypothesis stays valid until proven otherwise.

#+begin_quote
  /In arguing that science proceeds by the deductive technique of seeking to falsify hypotheses, thereby showing that the traditional view of science as inductive is incorrect, Popper suggested that we should construe science as a sequence of ‘conjectures and refutations’ (this phrase constitutes the title of one of his books). We have a problem, and try to solve it by conjecturing what the solution might be. We test the conjecture; a negative outcome refutes it, a positive outcome ‘corroborates’ but does not confirm it; it might still be refuted by further evidence./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /It would be natural to think that the more probable an hypothesis seems, the better justified we are in accepting it if it is in competition with a less probable-seeming one. But Popper argued that improbable hypotheses are scientifically preferable, on the grounds that there is an inverse relationship between an hypothesis’ probability and its informational content: the more information it contains, the more ways it might be wrong; and therefore the more valuable it is to science if it resists efforts to falsify it. Because a scientific theory cannot be conclusively established as true, Popper invoked the idea of ‘verisimilitude’ or ‘truth-likeness’ to characterize good scientific theories – ‘good scientific theories’ being those that resist stringent efforts to refute them./
#+end_quote

- A criticism of Popper's falsificationism is that a theory cannot simply be rendered invalid by smaller contravening observations. Rather, the entire theory must consistently fail on many parts for it to be debunked.
- The author then notes Thomas Kuhn's contributing work on paradigms, in his book *Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, which I've already read!
- Towards the last part of his career, Wittgenstein modified his earlier beliefs on language. Initially, he argued that language has an underlying structure that holds the key to understanding it. Now, he argued that instead of  asingle such structure, there are various contexts where each word assumes a specific role, and when taken out of this context, the word starts to mean differently.
- From this new Wittgensteinian view of language came a strand of Analytic Philosophy known as "ordinary language" philosophy. It rejected the need for formal logic as a unifying language for philosophy, and insisted that ordinary or common language is enough, provided proper nuance and context are applied.

#+begin_quote
  /Examining language and the way it is used is our access to examining how we think, and our thought reveals what we take the world to be, and why we think of it that way. In effect, therefore, you could say that an examination of our language is an examination of our world – of our world, the phenomenal reality we live in and talk about, leaving it to a further and different project (science) to formulate ways of thinking about what the world is (so to speak) noumenally: the structure and properties of reality behind and beyond everyday experience./

#+begin_quote
  /The idea that mental states cause behaviour, and that we explain and predict behaviour by ascribing it to mental states as its inner origin, is such a natural one that it constitutes the ordinary assumed view of most people.

Arbitrary facts about our personal biographies might explain our personal inclinations in the matter, but in the absence of any other reasons (let alone good and cogent ones) for saying ‘hurray’ and ‘boo’ and wanting others to join in, how does this amount to an ethical theory?/

  /Feminist philosophy arose contemporaneously with the increasing influence of social and political feminism in the second half of the twentieth century, and is set to be a major component of all future thinking.

This is one of the most significant developments in philosophy in the later part of the twentieth century.

  /In ordinary experience and in our naturalistic, scientific investigations of the world, we are conscious of  and states-of-affairs outside us and indeed within us – an itch, a pain, a hunger pang. This is the ‘natural attitude’. Phenomenology does not investigate these matters. It investigates consciousness itself. To focus just on the nature of consciousness requires a ‘reduction’, a withdrawing of attention from anything other than consciousness itself so that only it is under examination. One does this by the epoche or suspension of attention to everything that is not consciousness itself, by ‘bracketing’ all considerations of the representational content of consciousness or what it is related to. ‘Bracketing’ is not a denial of the reality of things, but a way of holding them in abeyance so that they do not distract attention from the invariant features of consciousness, which is what the phenomenological reduction is seeking to make visible. This marks a sharp distinction between psychology as an empirical science from phenomenology as a ‘pure’ science in the Kantian sense, that is, which addresses only the nature and conditions of consciousness as such, shrived of any considerations of what it represents or connects with./

* THE HOUSES OF HISTORY
** /Anna Green; Kathleen Troup/


#+begin_quote
  /Both past and present are always intertwined in historical practice. Historians seek to understand people whose lives and sensibilities were very different to their own. We also try to make sense of the present by investigating the processes of change over time that contributed to shaping the world in which we live. Both these activities are conducted with historical hindsight, which consists of at least two interrelated dimensions. Each new generation of historians brings different questions to the study of the past, drawing upon their own collective experiences and socio-economic contexts. In addition, new scholars critically engage with and respond to the perspectives of the earlier generation. The questions that emerge from this process generate new interpretations or analyses that make connections, or identify patterns of change, of which our historical actors were not always aware./

  /The experience or knowledge of the repression, violence, and war of the twentieth century had a profound impact on the thinking of more than one generation of historians in many different parts of the world. Progressive historians in the United States and Whig historians in England largely retained faith in the positive evolution of mankind in the first half of the twentieth century. But after the First World War, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Second World War and the Holocaust, and struggles for colonial independence, historians coming to maturity in the post-war period increasingly became less enamoured of theories of progress, less inclined to believe in a trajectory of human betterment./

  /During the late twentieth century, orthodox empirical historians were riven by disagreement over the ideas and implications of poststructuralism. Empiricism and poststructuralism are, in pure form, conflicting epistemologies. The first is based upon the belief that it is possible to reconstruct the past from surviving evidence, that historians are able to gain access to aspects of a real past. In contrast, poststructuralists argue that our understanding of the past, and our sources, are framed through structures of language and discourse, and that there is no access to an unmediated past. These two perspectives are encapsulated in the terminology of reconstruction (empiricist) and representation (poststructuralist)./

  /Fundamentally, poststructuralism supports a relativist position and destroys any claim to historical objectivity. Not only are multiple and sometimes mutually exclusive interpretations possible, they are inevitable, and the truth of an interpretation cannot be verified. All histories are equally representative of reality and therefore equally fictitious./

  /While the operation of power within societies tends to reinforce the dominant discourse of that society, for Foucault power did not operate from above through a single agency (such as ‘the government’) but worked diffusely, locally; resistance occurred similarly, in a series of local disruptive struggles rather than in a mighty dialectical engagement./

  /For Marx, the rest of society – the superstructure of political institutions and legal systems – were derived from the forces and relations of production. In other words, he did not ascribe an independent existence to the realm of human consciousness and ideas, but perceived these as arising out of our material existence and the relationships of production./

- This quote is from an essay by Christopher Hill:

#+begin_quote
  /Codes of morals are always bound up with a given social order. Feudal society had been dominated by custom, tradition. Money had been comparatively unimportant. It was an outrage to the morals of such a society that men’s rents should be sharply raised, and that if they could not pay, they should be turned out on the roads to beg, steal or starve. In time, the needs of growing capitalism produced a new morality – the morality of “God helps those who help themselves.” But in the sixteenth century the idea that profit was more important than human life, so familiar to us that we have lost our sense of moral indignation, was very new and very shocking./

- The Annales school introduced the concept of a total history, where various multiple facets of historical past are presented and arranged. Bloch and Febvre used various themes and topics to frame this totality. Braudel used time, portraying a history of the Mediterranean region across centuries.



* THE INVENTION OF SCIENCE
** /David Wootton/

#+begin_quote
  /Modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe saw a nova, or new star, and 1704, when Newton published his Opticks, which demonstrated that white light is made up of light of all the colours of the rainbow, that you can split it into its component colours with a prism, and that colour inheres in light, not in objects. There were systems of knowledge we call ‘sciences’ before 1572, but the only one which functioned remotely like a modern science, in that it had sophisticated theories based on a substantial body of evidence and could make reliable predictions, was astronomy, and it was astronomy that was transformed in the years after 1572 into the first true science. What made astronomy in the years after 1572 a science? It had a research programme, a community of experts, and it was prepared to question every long-established certainty (that there can be no change in the heavens, that all movement in the heavens is circular, that the heavens consist of crystalline spheres) in the light of new evidence. Where astronomy led, other new sciences followed./

  /Those who accept Darwin’s theory of evolution can have no patience with a Biblical chronology which places the creation of the world 6,000 years ago, but what we may term historical humankind (humans who have left written records behind them), as opposed to archaeological humankind (humans who have left only artefacts behind them), has existed only for about that length of time, some 300 generations./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The nova of 1572 was not the cause of the Scientific Revolution, any more than the bullet which killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914 was the cause of the First World War. Nevertheless, the nova marks, quite precisely, the beginning of the Revolution, as the death of the archduke marks the beginning of the war. For the Aristotelian philosophy of nature could not be adapted to incorporate this peculiar anomaly; if there could be such a thing as a new star, then the whole system was founded on false premises./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /But since 1572 the world has been caught up in a vast Scientific Revolution that has transformed the nature of knowledge and the capacities of humankind. Without it there would have been no Industrial Revolution and none of the modern technologies on which we depend; human life would be drastically poorer and shorter and most of us would live lives of unremitting toil. How long it will last, and what its consequences will be, it is far too soon to say; it may end with nuclear war, or ecological catastrophe, or (though this seems much less likely) with happiness, peace and prosperity. Yet although we can now see that it is the greatest event in human history since the Neolithic Revolution, there is no general agreement on what the Scientific Revolution is, why it happened – or even whether there was such a thing. In this respect the Scientific Revolution is quite unlike, for example, the First World War, where there is general agreement on what it was and a fair amount of agreement on why it happened. An ongoing revolution is a nuisance for historians: they prefer to write about revolutions that happened in the past – when, in reality, this one is still continuing all around us./
#+end_quote

- The notion of the 17th century Scientific Revolution as /the/ Scientific Revolution is very recent, dating back to the 1950s. Prior to that, there were two Scientific Revolutions: one with Newton's classical physics, and one with Rutherford's nuclear physics.
- The main thesis is that Scientific Revolution is defined by the similar revolution in language.
- Scientific Revolution was less about ideas, and more about the experience.
- The author seems to emphasize the relationship of language and science in the history of modern science.
- Two critical factors to repudiating old theories on the shape of the earth:
  - The discovery of the new world is sponsored by kings, so the issue has become a part of political realm, not just a philosophical debate.
  - The discovery added *new* knowledge; old theories relied on interpretation of *old* knowledge and theories.
- The scientific revolution involved the mathematization of nature. Perspective drawing, cartography, and ballistics were areas where mathematics found great practical use.
- By the time Galileo started studying the heavens, telescopes have been in use by lots of people. What gave Galileo the edge is his constant tinkering to improve his telescope, especially its magnification.
- While experimentation is not a new thing, what was new in the Scientific Revolution is the collaborative method of doing science. Various scientists kept constant communication with each other, and preformed experiments, published results, and others built on these previous works to improve on their own experiments.
- Alchemy was defeated by open and public practice of science. Experiments have to be replicable, communicated in clear language. This was the opposite of alchemy, which insisted on secrecy and obscurity.

#+begin_quote
  /To a certain degree, if the world is orderly and predictable, it is because we have worked to make it so by developing technologies that give us control over nature. If we can model its processes, it is because we have developed our own capacities for making nature-like artefacts. It was therefore inevitable that the advocates of the experimental method in the seventeenth century would come to insist that the universe is like a clock, for clocks are embodiments of the principles of order, regularity and efficiency and, moreover, it is we who have made them. If we think of God as a clockmaker, then we can be confident that he will have made a world amenable to experimental enquiry. In the Middle Ages the heavens had been compared to clockwork; now the same principle of regularity was, it was claimed, to be discovered in the sublunary world./
#+end_quote

- The analogy of God as a clockmaker, and the universe as a clockwork, began in the 17th century. It's interesting that such an analogy was even made, as clocks in the 17th century aren't very reliable.

#+begin_quote
  /The point about evidence is not that it was a natural type of argument to rely on, nor that it was a sort of argument that was obviously bound to be successful; the point is that relying on evidence just happened to work rather well./

  /The intellectual apparatus of the new science – facts, experiments, theories, laws of nature, evidence – did not establish its worth by philosophical arguments; its success depended upon the fact that, in practice, it produced good results. There may be inhabited worlds in which no culture ever becomes evidence-based; and there could, for all we know, be universes in which looking for evidence simply doesn’t pay off – in which the sceptics not only win the arguments but have the facts on their side. Reality and the new science happened, in certain areas of physics, to dovetail quite neatly together. This was, in the end, good luck./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /We do not just live with the technological benefits of science: the modern scientific way of thinking has become so much part of our culture that it has now become difficult to think our way back into a world where people did not speak of facts, hypotheses and theories, where knowledge was not grounded in evidence, where nature did not have laws. The Scientific Revolution has become almost invisible simply because it has been so astonishingly successful./

* THE KING'S TWO BODIES
** /Ernst Kantorowicz/

#+begin_quote
  /Mysticism, when transposed from the warm twilight of myth and fiction to the cold searchlight of fact and reason, has usually little left to recommend itself. Its language, unless resounding within its own magic or mystic circle, will often appear poor and even slightly foolish, and its most baffling metaphors and highflown images, when deprived of their iridescent wings, may easily resemble the pathetic and pitiful sight of Baudelaire's Albatross. Political mysticism in particular is exposed to the danger of losing its spell or becoming quite meaningless when taken out of its native surroundings, its time and its space./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Infinite cross-relations between Church and State, active in every century of the Middle Ages, produced hybrids in either camp. Mutual borrowings and exchanges of insignia, political symbols, prerogatives, and rights of honor had been carried on perpetually between the spiritual and secular leaders of Christian society. The pope adorned his tiara with a golden crown, donned the imperial purple, and was preceded by the imperial banners when riding in solemn procession through the streets of Rome. The emperor wore under his crown a mitre, donned the pontifical shoes and other clerical raiments, and received, like a bishop, the ring at his coronation. These borrowings affected, in the earlier Middle Ages, chiefly the ruling individuals, both spiritual and secular, until finally the/ sacerdotium /had an imperial appearance and the/ regnum /a clerical touch./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The implication of all this is not that the lawyers consciously borrowed from the acts of the early Councils, but that the fiction of the King’s Two Bodies produced interpretations and definitions which perforce would resemble those produced in view of the Two Natures of the God-man. Anyone familiar with the christological discussions of the early centuries of the Christian era will be struck by the similarity of speech and thought in the Inns of Court on the one hand, and in the early Church Councils on the other; also, by the faithfulness with which the English jurists applied, unconsciously rather than consciously, the current theological definitions to the defining of the nature of kingship. Taken all by itself, this transference of definitions from one sphere to another, from theology to law, is anything but surprising or even remarkable. The quid pro quo method—the taking over of theological notions for defining the state—has been going on for many centuries, just as, vice versa, in the early centuries of the Christian era the imperial political terminology and the imperial ceremonial had been adapted to the needs of the Church./
#+end_quote

- In the context of bishops, the concept of /persona mixta/ is representation of the bishop as both a man of the Church and a vassal of the King.
- The King was also treated as /persona mixta/, at least until it was formally repudiated by the Church. But at the time of the Norman Anonymous, the concept is still widely accepted.

#+begin_quote
  /With the King’s Two Bodies the doctrine of the persona mixta seems to have no direct relation. The duplication expressed by the concept of the persona mixta refers to temporal and spiritual capacities, but does not refer to bodies natural and politic. Or could it be that the king’s impersonal and immortal super-body appeared, during the earlier Middle Ages, in some way or the other, embedded in that very idea of his spiritual character resulting from the clericalization of the royal office? In fact, it is in that direction that the Norman Anonymous, one of staunchest defenders of the spiritual essence of a Christ-like kingship, sends us, and we can do nothing better than to take his hint and follow his guidance./
#+end_quote

- The kings of the Old Testament were Christ's foreshadowers. After Christ, the kings now became imitations. But ultimately, the kings before and after Christ all bore the same dual identity, albeit imperfectly and by virtue of grace.
- The Norman Anonymous took the concept of duality to a lot of extremities, even ascribing this /persona mixta/ to pagan Roman emperors.

#+begin_quote
  /Norman author’s vision of the king as a persona geminata is ontological and, as an effluence of a sacramental and liturgical action performed at the altar, it is liturgical as well. His vision is, on the whole, more closely related to the liturgy, to the holy action which itself is image and reality at the same time, than to the distinction of functional capacities and constitutional competencies, or to the concepts of office and dignity as opposed to man./

* THE LANDSCAPE OF HISTORY
** /John Lewis Gaddis/

#+begin_quote
  /We know these things about the future only from having learned about the past: without it we’d have no sense of even these fundamental truths, to say nothing of the words with which to express them, or even of who or where or what we are. We know the future only by the past we project into it. History, in this sense, is all we have./
#+end_quote

- The disadvantage of being an observer in the present is that you only see within the extent of your field of vision. A historian, by contrast, has the advantage of seeing past events from multiple perspectives.

#+begin_quote
  /If you think of the past as a landscape, then history is the way we represent it, and it’s that act of representation that lifts us above the familiar to let us experience vicariously what we can’t experience directly: a wider view./

* THE MAKING OF EUROPE
** /Robert Bartlett/

#+begin_quote
  /Europe is both a region and an idea./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /This book approaches the history of Europe in the High Middle Ages from one particular perspective, by concentrating on conquest, colonization and associated cultural change in Europe and the Mediterranean in the period 950–1350./

  /The theme is not only colonial conquest and immigration, the moving edge, but also the foundation of an expansive and increasingly homogeneous society – ‘the Making of Europe’./
#+end_quote

- A good way of measuring growth of Latin Europe is through the bishoprics.

#+begin_quote
  /Latin Christendom consisted of those churches worshipping in Latin and according to a rite approved by the papacy, usually the Roman rite. One of the striking features of the western Church is, in fact, its insistence on the dominance of one liturgical language and one cultic form. There are a few dubious or borderline cases, where special circumstances allowed other languages or rites within the Roman obedience, but these were few in number and diminished over time./
#+end_quote

- The Christians in Europe increasingly referred to themselves as the Latin Christians, and their world is the Latin Christendom.

#+begin_quote
  /'Latin’ was a name which adherents of the Latin rite and Roman obedience applied to themselves, but it is hard to credit the Latin liturgy itself with expansionary power. Indeed, one aspect of the expansion we are discussing seems to be the imposition of that liturgy on Christian regions of divergent tradition by the papacy and other interested groups; and if the spread of the liturgy is conceived of as a consequence of the expansionary movement, it is hard also to have it as a cause./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The mere existence of the institution is not enough to account for the rise of the papal monarchy. The papacy is best seen as an enterprising and initiatory institution, but one that made its greatest mark by taking advantage of changes in the world around it. The great popes of the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries did indeed have a consciously pursued goal of ‘extending the bounds of the Church’, but they did so in a world where dynamic growth of a material kind was already afoot./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Mere adherence to the Latin liturgy and obedience to Rome were not enough to qualify for full inclusion in the ecclesia, that is, in society. As the men of Frankish Europe intruded upon societies around and unlike their own, they found both non-Christians (in eastern Europe and the Mediterranean lands) and local variants of Christianity (notably in the Celtic countries). Their response was to equate the two, if the Christian societies did not have the social and legal characteristics with which they were familiar. The expansion of the High Middle Ages was a matter not simply of Latin Christendom growing, but of the territorial growth of a certain kind of society. It tended to describe itself as Roman and Christian, but also recognized the Celtic lands as alien to it. By the eleventh century ‘Latin Christendom’ can be used to designate not merely a rite or an obedience but a society./
#+end_quote

- The High Middle Ages was a period of aristocratic diaspora. Many gained and settled in new territories through the crusades. But some also expanded through marriage and alliances.

#+begin_quote
  /One measure of the importance of the expansion of Frankish aristocrats in the High Middle Ages is their role in providing ruling dynasties for Europe. Just as the minor princes of Germany would later provide a useful fund of kings for the new nationalist monarchies of the nineteenth century, so the great families of medieval France sent out offspring to sit on distant thrones./
#+end_quote

- Military vassals are easy to get. But land is much scarcer. This scracity can be seen as a factor for aristocratic diaspora, as the nobility searched for lands to possess.

#+begin_quote
  /The more land one had, the more knights one could enfeoff, and the more knights one had, the easier it was to conquer new lands./
#+end_quote

- Feudalism grew out of this aristocratic expansionism. Newcomers build their fiefdom, provide privileges to their knightly retinues, and recruit locals to tend the lands.
- The language of feudalism is mainly loan words, since the system was imposed by immigrant nobilities and knights unto the native population.

#+begin_quote
  /Levels of hostility between incomer and native obviously varied according to the circumstances of the intrusion and the pre-existing cultural differences between the two groups. The barrier between Christian and non-Christian was normally unbridgeable, but the survival of Muslim aristocracies in some places shows that extermination was not the only path. The intrusive aristocracies of the High Middle Ages had differing relationships with and attitudes to indigenous peoples and cultures and could turn out to be an alien and conquering élite, an élite monopolizing power but receptive to native culture or a group mingling with native aristocrats./

#+begin_quote
  /The heavy horsemen of the Middle Ages lived in the wheat age but looked like men of the steel age./
#+end_quote

- Heavy cavalry is basically the military elite of the High Middle Ages. The horses and equipment are expensive.

#+begin_quote
  /There had been fortifications in Europe for millennia and they had taken many different forms. No one set of criteria will differentiate absolutely sharply the fortresses of the early Middle Ages from the castles of the High Middle Ages. There will always be areas of ambiguity and overlap. Nevertheless, if we are content with a characterization of the difference that covers most cases, we can say that the castles which covered Europe in the tenth to twelfth centuries were distinguished by two features – they were small and they were high./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The most distinctive physical feature of castles, their height, was in part a consequence of their size. They were not intended to oppose truly massive earth ramparts to the attacker. They were not places of refuge for whole communities and hence did not have large reserves of manpower for defence. Castles were intended to be defensible by a few and the way to ensure this was to make them small but high. The height gave them both inaccessibility and dominance of their surroundings. Inside a castle, a garrison was hard to get at but could also command everything within sight./
#+end_quote

- Improved fortifications through castles was matched by improvements in siege warfare, namely the development of siege machinery like catapults and trebuchets.
- Military techniques spread through 3 ways: conquest; imitation; and planned development.

#+begin_quote
  /As the military aristocracy of western Europe extended its lordship outwards in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, its members created not only conquest states and colonial societies, but also representations of themselves and their enterprises. These images of conqueror and conquest are enshrined in the histories and charters that their clerical brothers and cousins drew up and in the songs and stories that the aristocracy composed and enjoyed. Written memorials of this kind record the words and gestures of famous conquerors. They elaborate a terminology and rhetoric of expansionary violence. Mythic motifs recur: the first coming of the conquerors; the figure of the heroic military pioneer, perhaps a poor knight or noble, who took the gamble of foreign conquest; the superhuman exploits of the new men. What emerges from such records is the self-image of the conqueror./
#+end_quote

- Medieval conquerors cultivated an image of ferocity in their battles. It can be seen as like glorifying the violence, but that is part of the point. Such image is meant to convey their martial prowess and impose sense of authority.

#+begin_quote
  /The experience of successful conquest and colonization imprinted itself upon the minds of princes, lords and clerics, so that they came to expect or anticipate that the future would see more new lordships created by force, more planned clearance and settlement, ever more income from tribute, taxes, rent and tithes./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Conquest and colonization could thus be represented as a dramatic and formative process and often appeared to participants (or victims) as a distinct, fateful and perhaps heroic story. The very first generation of settlers told tales of their arrival in the new land, portrayed the villains and heroes of the early years and picked out certain moments for mythic treatment. Hence a body of tale, legend and memory was generated, part of which is recoverable because it was transmitted in writing. The conquerors and immigrants produced a literature of conquest./
#+end_quote

- The designation of the term 'Franks' for the crusaders in 1099 isn't a novelty of the First Crusade. Long before that, because of strong associattions with the Carolingian Empire, western European conquerors have been referred to collectively as Franks.

#+begin_quote
  /The term ‘Frank’ thus referred to westerners as settlers or on aggressive expeditions far from home. It is hence entirely appropriate that when the Portuguese and Spaniards arrived off the Chinese coasts in the sixteenth century, the local population called them/ Fo-lang-ki, /a name adapted from the Arabic traders’/ Faranǧa. /Even in eighteenth-century Canton the western barbarian carried the name of his marauding ancestors./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Population growth is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the expansion of a culture area; for technical and organizational advantages, along with such intangibles as cultural prestige and aggressive drives, can result in the dissemination of a culture without much in the way of demographic change – the partial westernization of Japan, for example, has taken place with absolutely negligible western settlement./
#+end_quote

- Migration also occurred throughout Europe during the High Middle Ages, though distribution is unequal. One particularly large example of migration is with the /Reconquista/ in the Iberian peninsula. The place known then as Al-Andalus was relatively empty. The Latin conquest of the region brought with it the Christian populations that migrated and settled to the new lands, as shown also by the growth of bishoprics after the /Reconquista/.
- Migration was to an extent fairly organized. Kings and lords gifted lands to their loyal vassals. These gifts came with specific terms, like how large the land is, how many can be settled in it, what crops are to be grown, etc.

#+begin_quote
 /The vast movement of new settlement, migration and colonization that took place in the High Middle Ages was based on this model of labour recruitment, not on enserfment or capture. The free village, consciously designed to draw new settlers, could be found everywhere, most notably in the parts of Europe, such as the Iberian peninsula and the lands east of the Elbe, which were opened up to large-scale immigration in this period./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The settlers who came to newly established villages had to be given special conditions and privileges, both to encourage them to come and to enable them to establish themselves. There had to be compensations for the long journey, the severance of family and local ties and, perhaps, the disposal of other property. The new conditions and status that were offered to them on the frontiers of settlement must be a magnet strong enough to break the bonds that held people in place. Then, when the migrants reached their new destination, the early years might be hard and precarious, especially if the settlements were indeed entirely new and the arable had to be created by clearing woodland or draining marsh. Lords had to be ready to surrender some rights and income in the early years in order to ensure that the settlement would become viable and profitable./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The only significant limitation on alienability arose from the lords’ desire to ensure that the purpose of the new plantation, namely the creation of an active and flourishing, but subordinate and rent-paying peasantry, would not be subverted. There was no advantage to them in land speculation, absenteeism or the encroachment of outside grandees. Provisos were thus sometimes made explicit that the new colonists could only alienate their property to someone who would be an acceptable replacement./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The new lands of settlement were, like all of medieval Europe, lands of lords, but they were also, and not necessarily paradoxically, lands of freedom./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /It is clear that many colonists were not landless men, but already peasant farmers in their homelands. Even those who were driven to emigrate by desperate circumstances sometimes had land to sell./

  /Emigration requires resources as well as will, and it has been noticed in some modern migratory movements that the typical migrant is in the middle of the socio-economic range, neither rich nor destitute, and hence with both the incentive and the ability to move and make a new start. Experienced farmers will also have been more attractive than the landless or destitute to lords and others recruiting labour./
#+end_quote

- Migrants are usually people who already have some land and capital, and think that settling into another place can be a profitable endeavor for them. The process of migration itself is relatively costly, and poor peasants do not have the financial capability to move away from their current situation.
- The primary machine of the feudal system is the water mill, used for grinding grains. It is both physically big and expensive, and feudal lords are the most common owners of such, as ordinary settlers do not have the finances for building a mill. The lord can then require the settlers to use the mill for grinding their crops, like corn, and the settlers have to pay for it.

#+begin_quote
  /The new settlers, new ploughs and new mills meant ‘improvement’/ (melioratio terrae), /and ‘improvement’ meant the expansion of cereal cultivation. What was involved was thus not simply a shift from wild to tamed, but a move to a highly particular form of land use. In many parts of Europe the changes of the High Middle Ages involved a step away from a human ecology that could support only a sparse population but exploited a large variety of natural resources, such as fish, honey and game, as well as livestock and cultivated crops, towards a more densely populated monoculture./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /From the point of view of prince, prelate or enterprising locator, of course, the health of the settled population was not central. What was important about planned colonization was that it turned non-revenue-producing resources into a fountain of corn and silver. Richer lords and more peasants – that seems an undeniable outcome of the new settlements of the High Middle Ages./
#+end_quote

- Written sources for feudal life in the High Middle Ages will naturally be skewed towards political, military, and eccesiastical topics. Such sources came from the literate class, and such sources serve the needs of the class that wrote them.
- Peasant life is underrepresented in such written evidence, as the peasants were illiterate, but also because day-to-day life depends on knowledge and skills that the lords do not consider relevant to their personal needs.
- Three main non-written sources: archaeology; village and field morphology; place names.

#+begin_quote
  /The history of rural settlement is a topic which demands the slow accumulation of laboriously recovered data – pottery fragments, charter references, field maps, etc. It is also an area in which new scientific methods, such as the chemical analysis of ceramics or the investigation of plant and animal remains, promise ever richer information of a quite novel kind. If collaborative and multidisciplinary scholarship is allowed to thrive, one eventual result will be a deeper, sharper and livelier picture of the new landscapes of the High Middle Ages./ 
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The twelfth and thirteenth centuries were a period of dramatic urbanization in virtually every part of Europe. The older cities grew population and expanded beyond their Roman or early medieval limits, while hundreds of new towns were established, often as part of a highly self-conscious policy of development./
#+end_quote

- Township in the Middle Ages can be defined in two way: economic and legal. They don't always overlap, which means that medieval urbanization can be viewed in two different ways.
- Urban settlements legally defined as such usually have charters that grant them special privileges, like freedom from feudal control and lower taxes.

#+begin_quote
  /Town freedom – the particular constellation of privileges and liberties associated with urban status – was thus an incentive for settlement even apart from any considerations of commercialization. Immigrants would settle in towns because they sought liberty, not simply because they wished to trade./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The surviving urban charters and laws offer insights into the interests and constraints which shaped the new towns of Europe in the High Middle Ages. To analyse them is to explore the ambitions, fears and intentions of the men who created and expanded these towns. It is possible to see, in their wording and provisions, the end product of negotiations, clashes and concessions between all the parties involved in the formation of new towns – the lord, the urban entrepreneurs, the church and the new colonists. The town charter was a document of great symbolic value representing a new start./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The western European urban model, which was devised in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, involved the privileging of a space and its inhabitants. Such a privileging required, by definition, an author, a lord. But the actual content of the privileges was not usually worked out afresh between each lord and his burgesses. Standardized sets of legal provisions were available by the twelfth century. At the most general level there were some basic principles of urban liberty, such as free status, exemption from tolls and the grant of limited monopolies, which were intrinsic to the very concept of a chartered town. On a more specific level, whole bodies of positive law regarding town administration, civil and criminal procedure and the regulation of economic activity could be borrowed by one town from another. The result was the creation of families of town law, groups of urban settlements whose legal arrangements were, at least initially, modelled on a ‘mother town’./
#+end_quote

- Languages are very diverse in the frontier regions of Latin Europe. Bilingualism is not uncommon, arguably even necessary in many instances.

#+begin_quote
  /It would be naive to describe the cultural situation on the frontiers simply in terms of pluralism, diversity or mingling. Languages were not all equal. Some had higher prestige because of the political or economic power of those who spoke them. It is clear, for instance, that it was speakers of Romance and Germanic languages who were spreading through expansionary migration and conquest, while Celtic, Slavic, Baltic and Arabic were losing ground. These developments of the medieval period had a permanent effect on the linguistic map of Europe. There was a strong colonial flavour to this linguistic expansion: German in Livonia and French in Syria were languages of conquest, which might offer privileges to those who mastered them. But the patterns were not simple. Native vernaculars were resistant and could revive. Linguistic change was not all one-way and linguistic conflict could have more than one outcome./

  /In any ethnically diverse society political competitors seek to manipulate or harness racial feelings of hostility and solidarity and their success in doing so is shaped not only by the relative numbers and wealth of the different ethnic groups but also by the overall shape of social and political life in the society. Arenas of conflict vary with time and place. In the high medieval peripheries arenas of especial importance were the Church, the princely court and the burgess community./

  /The mingling of peoples that resulted from high medieval colonial migration did not always juxtapose Christian and non-Christian; it often gave rise to societies in which different Christian ethnic groups lived in contact./

#+begin_quote
  /In these regions where Christian peoples of different law and language intermingled, the Church itself became an arena of ethnic competition. It was indeed one of the most highly charged fields of conflict and there are clear reasons for this. Ecclesiastical offices were profitable and brought power and so were obvious and visible targets for ambition, but more: since the clergy were the carriers of ritual authority, morality and learning, they defined and spoke for a community or group. To see one’s prelates and pastors become strangers in speech and nationality was a loss of voice and a destabilization of identity./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The Church was not simply an institution, but an institution with an avowed mission. Hence no struggle over ecclesiastical office took place without reference, if only tactical, to the duties of clerics, especially those entrusted with the cure of souls. Since pastoral care involved preaching, hearing confession, comforting, advising and condemning, it could only be effectively undertaken by a priest who could communicate with his flock in their vernacular./

  /Princely courts were, in the best of circumstances, culturally distinct from the surrounding society, centres of patronage, conspicuous consumption, cosmopolitanism and fashion, and their style might easily inflame clerical, puritanical or backwoods critics. If, in addition, a dominant faction at court, or even the ruler himself, were of alien birth or culture, these potential antagonisms would be given a sharper, ethnically phrased tone. By their very nature, princely courts tended to harbour foreign elements. They were the epicentre of political dynasticism, and dynasticism meant that political power was transmitted according to family not national priorities. Hence the recurrent unpredictable trauma of the wooing of foreign brides and the arrival of alien heirs./

- In the later Middle Ages, some of the great royal families in Eastern Europe died down due to lack of heirs. As a result, their territories passed on to foreign aristocrats, notably the Habsburgs.

  /In the later Middle Ages the Muslims of Spain were robbed of their law and gradually lost their language. The culmination of this assault came when they lost their ‘law’ in the deepest sense, their religion, in the forcible conversions of the years around 1500. In the sixteenth century it was their customs that proved unacceptable to the Christian majority. By the opening years of the seventeenth century it had been decided that their very stock, their genus, could no longer be tolerated. In early modern Spain a crucial criterion for promotion and power was ‘purity of blood’, a descent untainted by Jewish or Moorish ancestry. A blood racism of the modern kind had been born./

- Latin Christianity (aka Roman Catholicism) stands out among other Christian denominations — in the Middle Ages, and beyond — for the primacy of uniformity, both in rite (conduct of Mass in Latin), and in obedience (loyalty to the Bishop of Rome, the Pope).

#+begin_quote
  /While the papacy had enjoyed a position of prestige and centrality in western Europe since the very birth of official Christianity under Constantine, the means and mechanics supporting that position underwent a transformation during and after the eleventh century. Starting with the reform movement of the middle and later years of that century, papal power became greater, papal decisions more enforceable, ritual uniformity more real. One consequence was that Latin Christians identified themselves more often and more deeply as such. Reverence to St Peter, obedience to the pope and commitment to certain forms of worship and church government mingled and intensified./
#+end_quote

- The concept of 'Christendom' has always been about unity of faith. But increasingly during the Middle Ages it has gained a sense of territoriality(lands where Latin Christianity is practiced, by the ruler and by the ruled), and of quasi-ethnicity (racial discrimination of Christians towards non-Christians).

#+begin_quote
  /Crusading military orders, such as the Templars, Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights, were, in part, successful because they were improbable. Their animating idea involved a fusion of opposites. The eleventh-century knight was violent, acquisitive, unruly and lascivious. The eleventh-century monk was dedicated to peace, poverty, obedience and chastity. From these contradictory sources sprang the crusading orders of the twelfth century: knights who were poor, chaste and obedient, monks who were fighters. This combination of aggression and self-abnegation had enormous appeal, and soon these orders became among the wealthiest and most prestigious corporations in Christendom. They were the most powerful and enduring institutional results of the militarization of Christianity that characterized the eleventh and twelfth centuries./
#+end_quote

- Another factor for the success and longevity of crusading orders is their institutional structure. The leaders being non-dynastic means that killing off a leader doesn't have much benefit for the opponents, as they can be replaced quickly. This also ensures somewhat stable continuity, unlike with kingdoms where the death of the monarch can throw the establishment into chaos and infighting.
  - Author uses the phrase "Europeanization of Europe" to describe the political, military, cultural, even religious, changes that Europe underwent in the High Middle Ages. This Europeanization is actually the homogenizing of the continent, rooted in influence coming from France, Germany, and Italy — that is, the old Frankish Empire of Charlemagne.
- Naming children after saints used to be localized. Names of specific saints are popular within the region nearest to that saint's cultic center. Starting in the High Middle Ages, saint names became more widespread outside the usual centers of their cult.
- This naming scheme also shows a conflict between conquering immigrants and conquered natives, as the latter feel pressured to adopt names of saints from the former's home regions.

#+begin_quote
  /The transformation of cult and nomenclature between the tenth and thirteenth centuries was thus not simply a matter of the spread of certain names and saints in the wake of conquest and colonization. This certainly did happen, but it was paralleled and encompassed by the other trend, a shift towards a universalist nomenclature and cult which was more than just a successful localism writ large. Just as the English peasants of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries adopted the names of their lords, so the European populace, when choosing their children’s names, came to favour Mary and the apostles, those aristocrats among the saints./

#+begin_quote
  /The university was one of the most powerful instruments of cultural homogeneity to arise in the High Middle Ages. Growing gradually from the schools of logic, law and theology of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, these international centres of learning and education had, by the thirteenth century, acquired something like their modern form: corporate, degree-granting institutions run by teachers who lectured to, disciplined and examined students./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Most of these itinerant students eventually returned home, and the more successful of them attained high ecclesiastical and political positions in their native societies. Thus, by 1300, the non-military élite of the Latin West was being shaped by a standard educational experience. There was a uniformity to their technical language, intellectual habits, pedagogic expectations and teenage memories. By the thirteenth century the great prelates who helped run Europe had a common collegiate background in the lecture rooms of Paris and Bologna./

  /By 1300 Europe existed as an identifiable cultural entity. It could be described in more than one way, but some common features of its cultural face are the saints, names, coins, charters and educational practices touched upon in this chapter.

This is the Europeanization of Europe./

  /The implantation of new aristocracies, encastellation, urbanization, new peasant settlement, the development of documentary literacy, all effected a fundamental transformation in those lands along the periphery of Latin Europe where they were experienced./

  /A dominant, newly arrived population, led by knights and clerics, stiffened by burgesses and some farmers, but still, overall, a minority, confronted a large native majority, alien in language, culture, social structure and, often, religion. The minority had to take care of its own security, ensure its profits and control, suppress or transform the native population. Beyond the sometimes precariously held colonial towns and fiefs lay native polities that were not subjected: Gaelic or Lithuanian kings, Greek or Islamic states, that nurtured long-term plans of revanchism and revival. In polities like these warfare and competition between newcomer and native, settler and indigenous population, were taken for granted as a permanent feature of life./
#+end_quote

- Expansion in the High Middle Ages mostly meant creation of new aristocracies and kingdoms. While some existing monarchies did see their territories increase, by and large the newly conquered lands fell into the hands of new dynasties and created new fiefdoms.

  /Conquest, colonization, Christianization: the techniques of settling in new land, the ability to maintain cultural identity through legal forms and nurtured attitudes, the institutions and outlook required to confront the strange or abhorrent, to repress it and live with it, the law and religion as well as the guns and ships. The European Christians who sailed to the coasts of the Americas, Asia and Africa in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries came from a society that was already a colonizing society. Europe, the initiator of one of the world’s major processes of conquest, colonization and cultural transformation, was also the product of one./

* THE SECULAR ENLIGHTENMENT
** /Margaret Jacob/

#+begin_quote
  /The Enlightenment was an eighteenth-century movement of ideas and practices that made the secular world its point of departure. It did not necessarily deny the meaning or emotional hold of religion, but it gradually shifted attention away from religious questions toward secular ones. By seeking answers in secular terms—even to many religious questions—it vastly expanded the sphere of the secular, making it, for increasing numbers of educated people, a primary frame of reference./
#+end_quote

- Secular Enlightenment did not mean wholesale abandonment of religion. Indeed, many intellectuals of the period were also religious, or at least nominally belonged to major religious groups. But instead, secularism meant that the world is viewed from non-religious perspectives.

#+begin_quote
  /Between 1500 and 1700, Westerners discovered two new worlds: one in the heavens, the other on earth. These discoveries coincided with and helped further a vast expansion of commerce that brought yet more peoples and places into the Western orbit. Celestial and terrestrial space were reconfigured. Making sense of these monumental discoveries required new thought and language./
#+end_quote

- The last sentence in that quote is basically the thesis of *Invention of Science*.

#+begin_quote
  /Therein lay the roots of the Enlightenment: the unintended consequence of commercial and state-sponsored expansion. Paradoxically, as the power of absolute monarchies and the clergy that supported them grew in Europe—augmented as they were by global conquest—inventive responses to new spatial realities multiplied. Their combined weight secularized space and removed not only its boundaries but also its supernatural powers. They undermined belief in heaven and hell and the authority of absolutist regimes./
#+end_quote

- Enlightenment was influenced by the growing world as known by Europeans. The expansion of space meant that knowledge of such space has to adapt.
- This also comes full circle as Enlightenment then birthed the creation of public space, like cafes and pubs, where ideas freely flowed.

#+begin_quote
  /The intellectual and cultural shift described as the Enlightenment happened in only one century, and as such may be described as rapid for its time. The “for its time” part is the hardest for twenty-first-century people to understand./
#+end_quote

- lol.
- One early manifestation of secularism is on the concept of time. Specifically, the identification of the date of creation. In the late 18th century, almanacs became less concerned about defining the date of creation. By 1800, the idea of a 6000-year old Earth has disappeared among intellectuals.

#+begin_quote
  /The enlightened expansion of time could, however, be divorced from its materialist underpinning. The pious might believe that biblical stories of creation serve not as literal truth but as metaphors for a process that had actually taken many millennia. Yet materialism had enormous implications with staying power, and every believer in the Judeo-Christian tradition would—at some time—have to confront it. Materialist assumptions became the philosophical moorings upon which an entirely secular understanding of life and time rested./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Lacking any of the sacramental supports open to Catholics such as confession, Protestants had a particular temporal burden: the necessity to self-monitor their use of time, to classify their behavior as useful, or worthy in God’s eyes, or impious and in need of correction./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /One way of imagining the complex issue of temporal secularization would be to imagine a lessening of anxiety, of watchfulness about time in relation to salvation. For moderate Protestants in early modern England, time presented a paradox and therefore a source of anxiety. Regardless of how defined, by calendars or seasons, by feasts or fairs, time needed to be watched; its waste was to be scorned, its fruitful use, valued. The actions or motions that the pious take in the world had to be monitored for their virtuousness and made purposeful, and all actions had temporal consequences./
#+end_quote

- The book also explored the less known and more ordinary enlightened people through their written works. Some common threads in their beliefs include republicanism, disdain of organized religion, admiration for anything ancient Greek and Roman, etc.

#+begin_quote
  /Many of these small voices from the eighteenth century remain relatively unknown to our day. In some cases, we rely on unpublished manuscripts to form an acquaintance with them. They speak without assuming that they are in the vanguard of a movement of ideas that will transform Western thinking on a wide variety of topics. They are therefore all the more valuable because they allow us to see the “seepage” of ideas in an age that was coming to terms with the discovery of the world’s peoples, with religious conflict, and with vast differences in the wealth of regions close to home or far away. These ordinary voices also display a willingness to inspect and embrace the new and the foreign, even to endorse revolutionary reform./
#+end_quote

- The Dutch Republic became a focal point of secular Enlightenment. And especially for the French, it was a safe refuge from the systematic censorship and surveillance of King Louis XIV's regime.

#+begin_quote
  /In no other part of Western Europe did clandestine literature play as big a role as it did in the French Enlightenment. To be sure, such literature could be found throughout Europe, in various languages. But French was the foreign language known by Continental and British elites more than any other. Through that linguistic avenue Newtonianism also entered, albeit frequently dressed in heretical garments./

  /Hostile critics spotted in Rousseau’s articulation of the 'general will' a license for tyranny. That is both a perverse reading of his theory and an incorrect one. This is not to say that Rousseau’s account of the general will can be easily grasped. It is not one size fits all. Rather, the general will differs from country to country, and the republican theorist must be clear about the local institutions that need to be accommodated./

  /The lodges were liminal spaces where men and some women—although their membership was always controversial—could learn to deliver orations, vote, contribute to charitable causes, and meet relative strangers in an atmosphere that was solemn and at least before dinner, dignified. The lodges could instill reformist values; they could also reward aristocratic patronage and sponsorship. They could be schools of government, even places of worship for those disaffected from traditional religion. Perhaps just as important, on either side of the Channel and in the American colonies, men of different religions could live, if only a few hours a week, in harmony and toleration. While reading the philosophes, they could also live the new, enlightened culture, or at least a version of it./
#+end_quote

- Masonic lodges became safe spaces for progressive thought and disputations. This led to Freemasonry being accused of fueling the secularism that created the French Revolution. It became subject of much conspiracy theories, which continue to this day.

#+begin_quote
  /The Enlightenment in France depended partially on foreign influences, generally coming from England and the Dutch Republic. That does not detract from the brilliance of its leading lights nor the courage of the denizens of its clandestine markets.

  /In the 1790s, Paris became not only the center for dramatic political changes but also an emotional cauldron of frenzied expectations and debilitating fears.

  /The conversation about freedom and despotism predated the American and French Revolutions by several decades; it was an inherent part of the Enlightenment./

- This quote in particular relates to the thesis of /RR Palmer's/ *Age of Democratic Revolutions*, in that the twin Revolutions were grown from the same seed. It is in contrast with the common perception, even among contemporaries, that the American inspired the French Revolution.

#+begin_quote
  /The meaning of the Enlightenment resides in political structures and personal transformations that emerged in the course of the eighteenth century. These are most visible in the lives and ideas found in its last quarter./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Then as now, the political has often been personal. Seekers after alternatives to absolute monarchies and their churches filled civil society, dwelt in its cafés, coffee houses, salons, eating clubs, and lodges. There they could find the like-minded, or the pugnacious, even the outrageous and the subversive. Not least, their shelves offered free newspapers and journals. The century ended with revolutions—Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris, Belfast, Dublin, Naples—that focused minds on making new institutions, new laws, new hopes and dreams. All of them in this world, in time to be lived./

  /Rivalry between the great powers after 1917 was acutely affected by a battle of ideas that reached above and beyond the normal preoccupations of diplomatic practitioners accustomed to the European states system from 1815 to 1914.

  /Beyond the spectre of war loomed the more menacing spectre of revolution; a spectre that in the end hastened the advent of a war that from being a distant possibility grew into an immediate certainty./

  /Rearmament was consistently rejected by the left. Pacifism predominated.

- Author primarily argues that Communism revolution has always been an objective of the Soviet Union, from Lenin to Gorbachev. It was however a matter of how it's achieved and how propitious it is to pursue it.
- The issue, the author argues, is that both the contemporaries and the future historians neglected this underlying sentiment because the Soviet Union wasn't able to effectively perform their revolutionary duties. Ineffectiveness of conduct does not mean the conduct wasn't intentional.

#+begin_quote
  /The centrality of the role of Communism in the interwar years has taken a long time to be accepted by historians of international relations. The Grand Alliance between Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States in World War II and their falling out in the Cold War that followed had a deadening effect, suppressing within the minds of an entire generation any awareness of the profound conflict over Communism that predated the Second World War and played its own part in generating that war./

  /The purpose of this work is thus to reach beyond diplomacy and to return international Communism to where it actually was at the time: never far from centre stage, as an enduring if at times unspoken threat to those in charge of government on both sides of the Rhine; to return it, indeed, to the spotlight in accounting for the drama that unfolded between 1919 and 1941./

  /History has hitherto been excessively compartmentalised, if not chopped into pieces, not least separating the realm of ideas from the world of events. And with respect to periods, the interconnective tissue between the interwar era and the Cold War needs patching back together, to allow us at last to view them as an integral whole./

- From the beginning Lenin envisioned future revolutions to be more planned and organized, compared with historical ones like 1789, 1792, and 1848.
- As soon as Lenin and the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution, Britain immediately saw the dangers of their communist rhetoric, and the need to prevent similar revolutions from breaking out elsewhere.

#+begin_quote
  /In the interwar years the threat of revolution lay at the core, not along the periphery, of conflict and conflict resolution in Europe.

- As early as the 1920s both Soviet Union and Weimar Germany has been exploring common grounds for working together.
- A Comintern-led uprising in Germany in 1921 was initiated by local German leaders. Though partly financed by colleagues from Soviet Union, it did not have Lenin's backing. The perpatrators were reprimanded by Moscow. Lenin preferred to try to work with the Germans instead of antagonizing them.

  /Although Coolidge’s administration was isolationist, for the Republicans money mattered most. Markets had to be stabilised abroad just as at home. Business confidence was critical.

Moreover, the massive quantity of debt still owing from the European powers was an issue for financial markets./

- Crucial to understanding Hitler's anti-Semitism and anti-Bolshevism was his belief on the state as an organism. Jews and Communism were, in his mind, cancers that erode the purity of the state, and therefore had to be purged.

#+begin_quote
  /The view of the nation state as an organism carried with it the requirement of living space/ (Lebensraum) /and easily linked to the idea of racial purity, with the Soviet Union as both the main source of contamination and the land for colonisation./

  /This obsession with living space was thus not a by-product of the  need to offset the lack of colonies possessed by Britain and France but a direct extension of Hitler’s organicist image of the state. What counted was not territory as such—Hitler was utterly uninterested in recovering Germany’s former colonies in Africa, even when the British later tried to thrust them on him—but contiguous territory. Indeed; but the plain truth remains that hardly anyone took him sufficiently seriously./

- Soviet communism reached China as early as 1919, through Siberian route to Manchuria. The CCP was established in 23 August 1921.

  /The postwar system of collective security centred on the League of Nations could work only if the great powers on its council behaved responsibly in pursuit of their  national interests and in indifferently sanctioning those states that misbehaved. Thus the entire structure in Geneva hinged upon the decisions of a few who would act without bias and in everyone’s long-term interest, regardless of conditions prevailing at home and abroad. In the conduct of international relations, this was too much to ask.

  /The Soviet Union was no different from any of the great powers in taking the line of least resistance to Japan, and for good reason.

The forced collectivisation of agriculture was still in progress and industrialisation had been hastened at such a pace that it led to acute bottlenecks in the economy. Any immediate new military requirements would place unexpected and heavy burdens on a system already strained to the limits.

  /In the meantime, Soviet interests dictated that Europe had to remain a house divided. The one eventuality that Stalin desperately needed to forestall was the healing of postwar wounds that could make possible an entente between governments hostile to world revolution: the long-standing bogey of a common front against the Soviet Union.

Stalin’s order of priorities broke with those of Lenin and Trotsky, neither of whom believed that building socialism in one country was possible, whereas Stalin saw it as the overriding priority for Russia. Having outflanked both the left and the right, and having isolated all forms of opposition within the party, in 1929 Stalin proceeded to impose the collectivisation of agriculture and five-year plans of industrialisation, including the building of vast new cities beyond the Urals in the rural backwaters of Siberia./

Mass protests calling for release of those arrested in Asturias 1934 have swollen, while those aligned with the right began exodus to fascist Portugal.
- Stalin's policies in 1930s China were seen as less concerning by Western powers. For one, the CCP has been pushed back by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops.

  /How was it that so many distinguished and apparently intelligent people managed to get matters so badly wrong?

- Chamberlain's isolationism and anti-Bolshevism both influenced his appeasement policy on Hitler regarding Czechoslovakia.

#+begin_quote
  /It was not merely that Chamberlain held to the line of appeasing Germany and Italy while at all costs avoiding any contact with the Soviet Union. He also sought to bully his colleagues and force other states into adopting the same policy./

  /Although it is now accepted that in the face of Hitler’s determination to go to war over Czechoslovakia his own military command were completely at sixes and sevens over whether to oppose him and even launch a coup d’état, no one outside Germany, let alone inside, had any confidence that such a revolt could succeed.114 The most that can be said is that, were Germany to go to war and face not only Czechoslovakia but also the British, the French and possibly also the Russians, its economy and its military readiness in the west as well as the east were not such as to inspire much confidence in a speedy victory, if victory at all./
#+end_quote

- The author explicitly rebukes the common argument that Chamberlain was buying time to rearm when he agreed to give up Czechoslovakia to Hitler. But Chamberlain fought against rearmament in the Parliament, and preferred to hand over Czechoslovakia to the Nazis as bulwark against Soviet Union.

#+begin_quote
  /The pact naturally exacerbated the anti-Bolshevism of the appeasement camp and totally undermined pro-Soviet sentiment on the left. Having endured the news of the terror, this came as a final blow for some. Those who had swallowed their doubts in the name of the Popular Front against fascism now had to confront the reality of Soviet state interests./
#+end_quote

- Part of the failure of Chamberlain's appeasement policy is the prevailing assumption that for ideological reasons, Nazi Germany and Soviet Union cannot be allies.

#+begin_quote
  /The tendency to assume like-mindedness has invariably proved overwhelming, and wrong. Society is, and always was, a complex organism. Ideology and cultural tradition always belonged more to the realm of organisms than that of machines. This matters, because ideologies in the international system, once activated, can completely undercut predictability, as they do not operate within the parameters of more settled states. The assumption that the system is run by rational actors thus falls apart because the calculation of what is rational is contingent on culture and historical evolution. The difference is fundamental between, at its most extreme, a country taken over by fanatics bent on revolutionary change and a country governed by complacent, well-entrenched élites with much to lose. The former still believe they can deliver a shot that the opponent cannot return; the latter just hope that their own delivery lands the ball in the opponent’s service box./

  /Ideas at the extreme ends of the spectrum do not just disappear. They can vanish momentarily from our field of vision through evaporation from the surface.

But history tells us that this state of balance cannot be expected to continue indefinitely./

  /The bare bones of the archival record—the skeletal past—alone, vital as they are, give us the framework, but little of the essence. The meat of history comes to us only through the restoration of the prevailing ideas and dominant assumptions of an era, and the way in which these interacted with material life to push us to the edge of disaster. Writing the origins of the Second World War in ignorance of them cheats subsequent generations. History does offer warnings, if we care to recognise them for what they are./

* THE SPIRIT OF EARLY CHRISTIAN THOUGHT
** /Robert Louis Wilken/

#+begin_quote
  /Early Christian thought is biblical, and one of the lasting accomplishments of the patristic period was to forge a way of thinking, scriptural in language and inspiration, that gave to the church and to Western civilization a unified an coherent interpretation of the Bible as a whole. Needless to say, this means that any effort to mount an interpretation of the Bible that ignores its first readers is doomed to end up with a bouquet of fragments that are neither the book of the church nor the imaginative wellspring of Western literature, art, and music./
#+end_quote

- Author contends that early Christian thinkers, though influenced by Greco-Roman philosophy, nonetheless developed their own way of thinking. This uniquely Christian way of philosophy should be examined on its own merits, independently of its Aristotelian trappings.
- Well, I didn't expect the book to be unabashedly Christian in bias haha. It's all good, though I would still have preferred a less overtly religious viewpoint.
- Many of the early Christian thinkers were themselves bishops. Their writings, therefore, come from the context of a community that regularly worships God.
- The Church fathers were very explicit in identifying the bread and wine as the /literal/ body and blood of Christ. Considering the author is a Lutheran, this is definitely an expected viewpoint to take.

#+begin_quote
  /Although tradition has to do with handing on practices, teachings, and institutional forms, human beings do the handing on. From the beginning Christians honored those who had given witness to what they had received, most notably the martyrs and holy men and women. Christian faith is inexcapably bound up with the lives and words of actual persons, for the truth of what was handed on rested finally on the faithfulness of the/ traditores, /those who did the handing on./

  /Only as the biblical texts on the Holy Spirit were read in the context of the church's life and worship did they disclose their meaning./

- Jesus' "Agony in the Garden" became a significant point of contention in the 7th century. The debate on whether he has his own human will has ended in the confirmation that Jesus is God with two natures and two wills - divine and human.
- Well, the author did start referring to later bishops of Rome as pope.
- From the beginnings of Christianity, it has always been argued that faith and reason are incompatible. One counter argument is that, if this were the case, the back-and-forth between early Christian thinkers and pagan philosophers wouldn't have lasted for centuries, and wouldn't have taken the historical significance that it did.
- Augustine argues that authority is a necessity in knowledge. Autonomous reason is unreliable, if not outirght improbable. Truth is not something that can be discovered alone, and is reliant on what others have witnessed and reasoned throughout history.

  /Christian thinking is inescapably bound to the witness of others. From those who have gone before we learn to use language in a distinctive way, to perceive the relation between seemingly disparate aspects of Christian teaching, to know what is peripheral and what is essential. Those who have gone before teach us how to use such words as God, Spirit, hope, grace, sin, forgiveness, and as we grow accustomed to using them we conform our lives and thoughts to those who have gone before. Memory is essential for Christian thinking, and like all memory it is particular and privileges certain moments and events in the Christian past, certain books and ideas, certain terms, and most of all certain persons. It begins with what has been received./

  /The more we strive for virtue and holiness, the more we discover refractory forces within ourselves that war against our best efforts. What stands in the way of a virtuous life is not what comes from outside, for example, the evils of society or the iniquity of fellow humans, but our own passions and turbulent desires. Even when we seem to achieve a measure of tranquility in our lives, we learn that virtue does not make us immune from pain and sorrow. Human life offers no lasting peace, whether peace among nations, peace within the city, peace in the home, or peace in the inner chambers of the soul. In this life perfect happiness is illusory./

  /Events take place in space as well as in time, and the events on which Christian faith is based happened not only at a particular time in history, but also at specific places.

#+end_quote

- In classical antiquity, and throughout the early Christian history, ethics is instructed and learned primarily through biographies. Learning by example is considered the best way to learn, especially for moral and ethical thinking, and early Christian thinkers emphasized that virtuous acts should be accompanied by equally virtuous reasons.
- Four cardinal virtues: /prudentia, iustitia, temperantia, fortitudo/

#+begin_quote
  /The Christian intellectual tradition is an exercise in thinking about the God who is known and seeking the One who is loved. Lacking concepts in the mind and words on the tongue, we cannot speak about what we know, but if we do not love the God to whom these words lead, we do not understand./

  /Christian thinking, like all thinking, requires questioning, interpretation, argument. But reason has short wings. Without love it is tethered to the earth./
#+end_quote

  /The intellectual accomplishments of the early church would be much less compelling had Christian bishops not been trained in classical rhetoric and known how to use words effectively, to persuade and to inspire, and, not incidentally, to give pleasure to their readers./

  /The intellectual tradition that began in the early church was enriched by the philosophical breadth and exactitude of medieval thought. Each period in Christian history makes its own unique contribution to Christian life. The church fathers, however, set in place a foundation that has proven to be irreplaceable. Their writings are more than a stage in the development of Christian thought or an interesting chapter in the history of the interpretation of the Bible. Like an inexhaustible spring, faithful and true, they irrigate the Christian imagination with the life-giving water flowing from the biblical and spiritual sources of the faith. They are still our teachers today./

* THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS
** /Thomas Kuhn/

#+begin_quote
  /History, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or chronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of science by which we are now possessed. That image has been drawn, even by scientists themselves, mainly from the study of finished scientific achievements as these are recorded in the classics and, more recently, in the textbooks from which each new scientific generation learns to practice its trade. Inevitably, however, the aim of such books is persuasive and pedagogic; a concept of science drawn from them is no more likely to fit the enterprise that produced them than an image of a national culture drawn from a tourist brochure or a language text./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /If science is the constellation of facts, theories, and methods collected in current texts, then scientists are the men who, successfully or not, have striven to contribute one or another element to that particular constellation. Scientific development becomes the piecemeal process by which these items have been added, singly and in combination, to the ever growing stockpile that constitutes scientific technique and knowledge./
#+end_quote

- The author introduces the term *paradigm*, which describes scientific achievements that are (1) unprecedented, and (2) open-ended. This is very significant, as Thomas Kuhn is the one who popularized the term paradigm shift.

#+begin_quote
  /To be accepted as a paradigm, a theory must seem better than its competitors, but it need not, and in fact never does, explain all the facts with which it can be confronted./
#+end_quote

- Normal science within specific fields generally deal with expanding and working within the prevailing paradigms, rather than proving / disproving, replicating, or even supplanting, such paradigms.
- Three main problems tackled by normal science (in relation to paradigms): determination of significant facts; matching of facts with theory; articulation of theory.

#+begin_quote
  /A man may be attracted to science for all sorts of reasons. Among them are the desire to be useful, the excitement of exploring new territory, the hope of finding order, and the drive to test established knowledge. These motives and others besides also help to determine the particular problems that will later engage him. Furthermore, though the result is occasional frustration, there is good reason why motives like these should first attract him and then lead him on./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Rules, I suggest, derive from paradigms, but paradigms can guide research even in the absence of rules./
#+end_quote

- Paradigms can be established and firmly embedded within the respective fields, even without clear definitions of its particular characteristics.
- Scientists learn their craft primarily through established knowledge, as well as practical experience. And in the case of experience, they get to closely work within and learn the paradigms without necessarily knowing explicit rules that underpin such paradigms.

#+begin_quote
  /Discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly, i.e., with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induced expectations that govern normal science. It then continues with a more or less extended exploration of the area of anomaly. And it closes only when the paradigm theory has been adjusted so that the anomalous has become the expected. Assimilating a new sort of fact demands a more than additive adjustment of theory, and until that adjustment is completed—until the scientist has learned to see nature in a different way—the new fact is not quite a scientific fact at all./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Philosophers of science have repeatedly demonstrated that more than one theoretical construction can always be placed upon a given collection of data. History of science indicates that, particularly in the early developmental stages of a new paradigm, it is not even very difficult to invent such alternates. But that invention of alternates is just what scientists seldom undertake except during the pre-paradigm stage of their science’s development and at very special occasions during its subsequent evolution. So long as the tools a paradigm supplies continue to prove capable of solving the problems it defines, science moves fastest and penetrates most deeply through confident employment of those tools. The reason is clear. As in manufacture so in science—retooling is an extravagance to be reserved for the occasion that demands it. The significance of crises is the indication they provide that an occasion for retooling has arrived./
#+end_quote

- Putting paradigms to the test does not mean outright rejecting them. When a new theory is put forward, the main goal is to attempt to reconcile it with existing paradigm. Only once it has been resonably proven that the new theory is a much better alternative can the prevailing paradigm be replaced. The displacement of the old paradigm and the establishment of a new one happen simultaneously; they cannot, by virtue of normal scientific processes, coexist.

#+begin_quote
  /Though history is unlikely to record their names, some men have undoubtedly been driven to desert science because of their inability to tolerate crisis. Though history is unlikely to record their names, some men have undoubtedly been driven to desert science because of their inability to tolerate crisis./

  /Once a first paradigm through which to view nature has been found, there is no such thing as research in the absence of any paradigm. To reject one paradigm without simultaneously substituting another is to reject science itself. That act reflects not on the paradigm but on the man. Inevitably he will be seen by his colleagues as “the carpenter who blames his tools.”/
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a new tradition of normal science can emerge is far from a cumulative process, one achieved by an articulation or extension of the old paradigm. Rather it is a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals, a reconstruction that changes some of the field’s most elementary theoretical generalizations as well as many of its paradigm methods and applications. During the transition period there will be a large but never complete overlap between the problems that can be solved by the old and by the new paradigm. But there will also be a decisive difference in the modes of solution. When the transition is complete, the profession will have changed its view of the field, its methods, and its goals/.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Confronted with anomaly or with crisis, scientists take a different attitude toward existing paradigms, and the nature of their research changes accordingly. The proliferation of competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the expression of explicit discontent, the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals, all these are symptoms of a transition from normal to extraordinary research. It is upon their existence more than upon that of revolutions that the notion of normal science depends./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /One aspect of the parallelism must already be apparent. Political revolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense, often restricted to a segment of the political community, that existing institutions have ceased adequately to meet the problems posed by an environment that they have in part created. In much the same way, scientific revolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense, again often restricted to a narrow subdivision of the scientific community, that an existing paradigm has ceased to function adequately in the exploration of an aspect of nature to which that paradigm itself had previously led the way. In both political and scientific development the sense of malfunction that can lead to crisis is prerequisite to revolution./
#+end_quote

- Author casts doubt on the idea that history of science is cumulative. Old theories don't just get superseded by better ones. Instead, old theories are completely replaced by new ones, because two paradigms cannot coexist, only one is correct.

#+begin_quote
  /If positivistic restrictions on the range of a theory’s legitimate applicability are taken literally, the mechanism that tells the scientific community what problems may lead to fundamental change must cease to function. And when that occurs, the community will inevitably return to something much like its pre-paradigm state, a condition in which all members practice science but in which their gross product scarcely resembles science at all. Is it really any wonder that the price of significant scientific advance is a commitment that runs the risk of being wrong?/
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Neither scientists nor laymen learn to see the world piecemeal or item by item. Except when all the conceptual and manipulative categories are prepared in advance—e.g., for the discovery of an additional transuranic element or for catching sight of a new house—both scientists and laymen sort out whole areas together from the flux of experience. The child who transfers the word ‘mama’ from all humans to all females and then to his mother is not just learning what ‘mama’ means or who his mother is. Simultaneously he is learning some of the differences between males and females as well as something about the ways in which all but one female will behave toward him. His reactions, expectations, and beliefs—indeed, much of his perceived world—change accordingly. By the same token, the Copernicans who denied its traditional title ‘planet’ to the sun were not only learning what ‘planet’ meant or what the sun was. Instead, they were changing the meaning of ‘planet’ so that it could continue to make useful distinctions in a world where all celestial bodies, not just the sun, were seen differently from the way they had been seen before./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The depreciation of historical fact is deeply, and probably functionally, ingrained in the ideology of the scientific profession, the same profession that places the highest of all values upon factual details of other sorts./
#+end_quote

- The author notes that history of science, compared with regular history, is very revisionist and intentionally obscures details of its part. History of science is portrayed as being linear and cumulative, and past mistakes and errors are omitted. Unlike regular history, which revels on revolutions, the story of scientific progress is constantly modified to render revolutions invisible, creating a sense of continuity and inevitability.

#+begin_quote
  /No theory ever solves all the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect. On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The transfer of allegiance fom paradigm to paradigm is a conversion experience that cannot be forced. Lifelong resistance, particularly from those whose productive careers have committed them to an older tradition of normal science, is not a violation of scientific standards but an index to the nature of scientific research itself. The source of resistance is the assurance that the older paradigm will ultimately solve all its problems, that nature can be shoved into the box the paradigm provides. Inevitably, at times of revolution, that assurance sems stubborn and pigheaded as indeed it sometimes becomes. But it is also something more. That same assurance is what makes normal or puzzle-solving science possible. And it is only through science that the professional community of scientists succeeds, first, in exploiting the potential scope and precision of the older paradigm and, then, in isolating the difficulty through the study of which a new paradigm may emerge./
#+end_quote

- Paradigms don't always prevail and triumph through scientific pursuit. In many cases, human connection is what ultimately gets the job done. This can be through persuasion with publications and lectures. But it could also be through personal communication, and at times even through just the force of reputation.
- One significant factor for adoption of new paradigm is when it's able to solve the biggest problems of the old paradigm.
- Another consideration for adopting the new paradigm is aesthetics or beauty. This now ties in with Hossenfelder's thesis, which rejects this mindset.

#+begin_quote
  /The early versions of most new paradigms are crude. By the time their full aesthetic appeal can be developed, most of the community has been persuaded by other means. Nevertheless, the importance of aesthetic considerations can sometimes be decisive. Though they often attract only a few scientists to a new theory, it is upon those few that its ultimate triumph may depend. If they had not quickly taken it up for highly individual reasons, the new candidate for paradigm might never have been sufficiently developed to attract the allegiance of the scientific community as a whole./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /But paradigm debates are not really about relative problem-solving ability, though for good reasons they are usually couched in those terms. Instead, the issue is which paradigm should in the future guide research on problems many of which neither competitor can yet claim to resolve completely. A decision between alternate ways of practicing science is called for, and in the circumstances that decision must be based less on past achievement than on future promise. The man who embraces a new paradigm at an early stage must often do so in defiance of the evidence provided by problem-solving. He must, that is, have faith that the new paradigm will succeed with the many large problems that confront it, knowing only that the older paradigm has failed with a few. A decision of that kind can only be made on faith./
#+end_quote

- However science settles its paradigmatic conflicts, ultimately it rests on specialized communities rather than appeals to political and social authorities. Science is inherently self-selecting and way more insulated from external interference than other professional fields.
- Towards the end of the book, Kuhn briefly notes that science as we know it is a product of Western Civilization, and that no other civilization has achieved the level of scientific pursuits that the West has done. West-centric, but not necessarily wrong given the time period the author lived in.

#+begin_quote
  /A scientific community consists, on this view, of the practitioners of a scientific specialty. To an extent unparalleled in most other fields, they have undergone similar educations and professional initiations; in the process they have absorbed the same technical literature and drawn many of the same lessons from it. Usually the boundaries of that standard literature mark the limits of a scientific subject matter, and each community ordinarily has a subject matter of its own./

* TO EXPLAIN THE WORLD
** /Steven Weinberg/

#+begin_quote
  /Before history there was science, of a sort. At any moment nature presents us with a variety of puzzling phenomena: fire, thunderstorms, plagues, planetary motion, light, tides, and so on. Observation of the world led to useful generalizations: fires are hot; thunder presages rain; tides are highest when the Moon is full or new, and so on. These became part of the common sense of mankind. But here and there, some people wanted more than just a collection of facts. They wanted to explain the world./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The word “discovery” in the subtitle is also problematic. I had thought of using The Invention of Modern Science as a subtitle. After all, science could hardly exist without human beings to practice it. I chose “Discovery” instead of “Invention” to suggest that science is the way it is not so much because of various adventitious historic acts of invention, but because of the way nature is. With all its imperfections, modern science is a technique that is sufficiently well tuned to nature so that it works—it is a practice that allows us to learn reliable things about the world. In this sense, it is a technique that was waiting for people to discover it./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In telling this story, I will be coming close to the dangerous ground that is most carefully avoided by contemporary historians, of judging the past by the standards of the present. This is an irreverent history; I am not unwilling to criticize the methods and theories of the past from a modern viewpoint. I have even taken some pleasure in uncovering a few errors made by scientific heroes that I have not seen mentioned by historians./
#+end_quote

- I like this. The author is very clear about how he tackles the work, and I respect that. This is the kind of history I love reading, the one where the author actually takes a stand, but hopefully also presents facts and arguments in good faith.

#+begin_quote
  /Science is not now what it was at its start. Its results are impersonal. Inspiration and aesthetic judgment are important in the development of scientific theories, but the verification of these theories relies finally on impartial experimental tests of their predictions. Though mathematics is used in the formulation of physical theories and in working out their consequences, science is not a branch of mathematics, and scientific theories cannot be deduced by purely mathematical reasoning. Science and technology benefit each other, but at its most fundamental level science is not undertaken for any practical reason. Though science has nothing to say one way or the other about the existence of God or an afterlife, its goal is to find explanations of natural phenomena that are purely naturalistic. Science is cumulative; each new theory incorporates successful earlier theories as approximations, and even explains why these approximations work, when they do work./
#+end_quote

- Two points:
  - Hossenfelder, in her attack on aesthetics, also interviewed Weinberg and argued with him on the value of beauty in science.
  - Science as a cumulative process is the opposite of how Kuhn sees the history of science. For Kuhn, science isn't cumulative because the old, once replaced by a newer paradigm, is thrown away.

#+begin_quote
  /The equations of our theories have certain simplicities, for instance treating certain species of particles in the same way, but these simplicities are not shared by the solutions of the equations, which govern actual phenomena./

  /The a priori presumption in favor of principles of symmetry arose from many years of experience in searching for physical principles that describe the real world, and broken as well as unbroken symmetries are validated by experiments that confirm their consequences. They do not involve value judgments of the sort we apply to human affairs./
#+end_quote

- The primary difference between ancient Greek science and modern science is that the former never bothered to prove its theories.

#+begin_quote
  /Today we test our speculations about nature by using proposed theories to draw more or less precise conclusions that can be tested by observation. This did not occur to the early Greeks, or to many of their successors, for a very simple reason: they had never seen it done./

#+begin_quote
  /There remains a poetic element in modern physics. We do not write in poetry; much of the writing of physicists barely reaches the level of prose. But we seek beauty in our theories, and use aesthetic judgments as a guide in our research. Some of us think that this works because we have been trained by centuries of success and failure in physics research to anticipate certain aspects of the laws of nature, and through this experience we have come to feel that these features of nature’s laws are beautiful. But we do not take the beauty of a theory as convincing evidence of its truth./
#+end_quote

- Greek mathematics is mainly based on geometry.

#+begin_quote
  /Mathematics is the means by which we deduce the consequences of physical principles. More than that, it is the indispensable language in which the principles of physical science are expressed. It often inspires new ideas about the natural sciences, and in turn the needs of science often drive developments in mathematics./

  /But mathematics is not a natural science. Mathematics in itself, without observation, cannot tell us anything about the world. And mathematical theorems can be neither verified nor refuted by observation of the world./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Where conflicts now sometimes arise between mathematicians and scientists, it is generally over the issue of mathematical rigor. Since the early nineteenth century, researchers in pure mathematics have regarded rigor as essential; definitions and assumptions must be precise, and deductions must follow with absolute certainty. Physicists are more opportunistic, demanding only enough precision and certainty to give them a good chance of avoiding serious mistakes./

  /Plato and Aristotle were both realists, but in quite different senses. Plato was a realist in the medieval sense of the word: he believed in the reality of abstract ideas, in particular of ideal forms of things. It is the ideal form of a pine tree that is real, not the individual pine trees that only imperfectly realize this form. It is the forms that are changeless, in the way demanded by Parmenides and Zeno. Aristotle was a realist in a common modern sense: for him, though categories were deeply interesting, it was individual things, like individual pine trees, that were real, not Plato’s forms./

#+begin_quote
  /There was no conception in the ancient or medieval world of science as something distinct from philosophy. Thinking about the natural world was philosophy. As late as the nineteenth century, when German universities instituted a doctoral degree for scholars of the arts and sciences to give them equal status with doctors of theology, law, and medicine, they invented the title “doctor of philosophy.” When philosophy had earlier been compared with some other way of thinking about nature, it was contrasted not  science, but with mathematics./

  /What is important in science (I leave philosophy to others) is not the solution of some popular scientific problems of one’s own day, but understanding the world.

The progress of science has been largely a matter of discovering what questions should be asked./

  /My purpose here in judging the past by the standards of the present is to come to an understanding of how difficult it was for even very intelligent persons like Aristotle to learn how to learn about nature.

  /It was essential for the discovery of science that religious ideas be divorced from the study of nature. This divorce took many centuries, not being largely complete in physical science until the eighteenth century, nor in biology even then./
#+end_quote

- I agree on this. Religion acts as a boundary for pursuit of knowledge, in that it starts lays out intellectual activities that are and are not permissible. Science needs to do away with such boundaries to advance, and the Scientific Revolution had to be disentangled from religion for it to truly flourish.
- Now of course as a Catholic myself, despite what I just stated, I don't exactly consider religious boundaries to be bad. In the context of science, it's useful to peel off the limits to an extent. But anyway this isn't something I'd like to elaborate in here haha.

#+begin_quote
  /It is not that the modern scientist makes a decision from the start that there are no supernatural persons. That happens to be my view, but there are good scientists who are seriously religious. Rather, the idea is to see how far one can go without supposing supernatural intervention. Only in this way can we do science, because once one invokes the supernatural, anything can be explained, and no explanation can be verified. This is why the “intelligent design” ideology being promoted today is not science—it is rather the abdication of science./

- The Moon is much easier to observe and reliably track across longer periods of time than the Sun. Hence, the most common type of calendar in the ancient world is lunar.
- Another significant difference between ancient and modern science is treatment of uncertainty. Ancient scholars never tried to seriously verify their calculations or even explore any possible uncertainties. In modern science, theories and calculations go through rigorous checks for imperfections, and such discrepancies have to be properly acknowledged and taken into account.

- Author notes that an "intellectual schism" that began in classical antiquity would continue on until Copernicus. The schism is based on how to approach astronomy:
  - Aristotelian theory: philosophers/physicians
  - Ptolemaic theory: astronomers/mathematicians

  /There is testimony to the influence of Arab science on Europe in a long list of words derived from Arabic originals: not only algebra and algorithm, but also names of stars like Aldebaran, Algol, Alphecca, Altair, Betelgeuse, Mizar, Rigel, Vega, and so on, and chemical terms like alkali, alembic, alcohol, alizarin, and of course alchemy./

- Aquinas sought to reconcile Aristotelianism with Christianity, through his work Summa Theologica. After hsi death, for some time Aquinas' work was banned and condemned. The condemnation was lifted later, alongside his canonization, and Thomism became integral to Catholic theology thereon.
- Author contends that while this condemnation is usually glossed over, it's actually a pretty big deal. Had the condemnation not been lifted, scientific progress would've been severely hampered, and Christianity at large would've been as opposed to science as Islam is.
- Author makes this interesting speculation that "the center of scientific work shifter eastward" as a result of the Hundred Years' War. I kinda don't buy it, but it's a curious thing that I might look into in the future.

  /Whatever the scientific revolution was or was not, it began with Copernicus./
#+end_quote

- Author focuses on the Commentariolus (vs. De revolutionibus) as Copernicus' landmark work. The argument is that it's in the Commentariolus that the fundamentals of Copernican theory is laid out, and it's also an expansion of Ptolemaic theory in a way.

#+begin_quote
  /Copernicus could not claim in the Commentariolus that his scheme fitted observation better than that of Ptolemy. For one thing, it didn’t. Indeed, it couldn’t, since for the most part Copernicus based his theory on data he inferred from Ptolemy’s Almagest, rather than on his own observations. Instead of appealing to new observations, Copernicus pointed out a number of his theory’s aesthetic advantages./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The theory of Copernicus provides a classic example of how a theory can be selected on aesthetic criteria, with no experimental evidence that favors it over other theories. The case for the Copernican theory in the Commentariolus was simply that a great deal of what was peculiar about the Ptolemaic theory was explained at one blow by the revolution and rotation of the Earth, and that the Copernican theory was much more definite than the Ptolemaic theory about the order of the planets and the sizes of their orbits./

  /Some distinguished physicists deplore the idea of a multiverse, because they cannot reconcile themselves to the possibility that there are constants of nature that can never be calculated. It is true that the multiverse idea may be all wrong, and so it would certainly be premature to give up the effort to calculate all the physical constants we know about. But it is no argument against the multiverse idea that it would make us unhappy not to be able to do these calculations. Whatever the final laws of nature may be, there is no reason to suppose that they are designed to make physicists happy./

  /Advice for idiots.

  /Focal length is a length that characterizes the optical properties of a lens. For a convex lens, it is the distance behind the lens at which rays that enter the lens in parallel directions converge. For a concave lens that bends converging rays into parallel directions, the focal length is the distance behind the lens at which the rays would have converged if not for the lens. The focal length depends on the radius of curvature of the lens and on the ratio of the speeds of light in air and glass./

- One crucial factor for Galileo's later plight is that he transferred professorship from Padua, administered by the Republic of Venice, to Florence. Venice has less papal interference than the rest of Italian peninsula, and being in Florence made Galileo more vulnerable to attack from the Church.

  /There are moments in history when a new technology opens up large possibilities for pure science. The improvement of vacuum pumps in the nineteenth century made possible experiments on electrical discharges in evacuated tubes that led to the discovery of the electron. The Ilford Corporation’s development of photographic emulsions allowed the discovery of a host of new elementary particles in the decade following World War II. The development of microwave radar during that war allowed microwaves to be used as a probe of atoms, providing a crucial test of quantum electrodynamics in 1947. And we should not forget the gnomon. But none of these new technologies led to scientific results as impressive as those that flowed from the telescope in the hands of Galileo./

  /A flat piece of glass does not separate the colors, because although each color is bent by a slightly different angle on entering the glass, they are all bent back to their original direction on leaving it. Because the sides of a prism are not parallel, light rays of different color that are refracted differently on entering the glass reach the prism’s surface on leaving the prism at angles that are not equal to the angles of refraction on entering, so when these rays are bent back on leaving the prism the different colors are still separated by small angles./

- Who invented calculus, Newton or Leibniz? The Royal Society concluded in favor of Newton.
- However, as it turns out, the anonymous committee that decided it was stacked with Newton supporters. The final report was drafter by Newton himself. The anonymous review that supported the report was also written by Newton.
- The concensus today is that both Newton and Leibniz invented calculus independently. The one result that did favor Leibniz is that it was him who coined the name calculus.

* WAR AND PUNISHMENT
** /H E Goemans/

#+begin_quote
  /Wars can end only when the minimum terms of settlement of both sides become compatible, when both are asking no more than the other side is willing to give up. Therefore, the fundamental cause of war termination is a change in the minimal demands, that is, the minimum terms of settlement of the combatants./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The main contribution of this book is the theoretical argument and empirical evidence that the decision to continue fighting or settle depends on the nature of the domestic political regime./
#+end_quote

- The author argues that semirepressive regimes with moderately exclusionary power dynamics have more to lose in a war loss, so they have the greatest incentive to continue fighting.
- Democratic regimes can feel the brunt in a moderate war loss. Autocratic regimes can still suppress opposition in a moderate loss, but a more significant defeat can result in the regime's collapse.

#+begin_quote
  /Neither the terrible havoc wrought by the First World War nor its place as a turning point in history is adequately explained by the events of July 1914. Consider the counterfactual: If the war had ended in November 1914, would this war have been considered as important? Would it even be referred to as "First World War"? To understand why so many people died, and why the war brought such important changes, we need to try to understand why the war lasted so long or, more precisely, why it continued./
#+end_quote

  /Historians and political scientists doing historical research can easily fall prey to the subtle problem of selecting the depth of their historical research to fit their expectations. For example, if you cannot find evidence for something you strongly believe, you are easily tempted to argue you cannot find it because it is hidden, and you will keep digging until you find it. In contrast, if you were to immediately find evidence supporting your beliefs, you would be tempted to forsake deeper historical probing that could contradict your beliefs./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /War breaks out because one side demands more than the other is willing to concede, that is, because states have incompatible terms of settlement, and each side hopes to procure its demands through war. In other words, each side expects to do better by going to war than by conceding the opponent his demands. Such demands can vary from maintenance of the status quo to unconditional surrender and need not be explicit./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Because of the costs of war, the overall pie to be divided between belligerents after war is smaller than it was before the war. In other words, war is a/ negative /sum game. If both sides knew how the pie would be divided after the war, both would be better off if they divided the pie accordingly before the war. Although their share of the pie would be the same, they would be dividing a larger pie and would therefore gain in absolute terms. In other words, because fighting is inefficient ex post there should exist ex ante bargains that rational states would both prefer to war./

- Ok I did not expect there to be actual data analysis and statistics in here lol. This feels like a show of how data science can be used for historical research, which is interesting for a book published in 2000.
- In the data analysis, Marcos regime was tagged as mixed power that transitioned into dictatorship after moderate defeat in the Vietnam War. Uhm... okay. That's a weird way of looking at it, but okay.
- The significance of this is that it would make him an exception in the author's thesis about mixed regimes suffering the most in a moderate defeat. In fact, the author tagged Marcos and South Korea's Park Chung-hee as the outliers for the group.
- So the author started with this thesis, /then/ chose WW1 as primary case study - not the other way around. This is important context that I admittedly didn't realize early on - this isn't quite a WW1 book, as much as it's a general war studies book.
- I was just thinking of how relevant this study would be on the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Sure enough, the author does have an article - sadly paywalled - about the war. And he seems to take view that - at least as of 2023 - it might be still too early to try a peace deal, which at this point might be a bad route to take for Ukraine.

  /The need to reward the people for their sacrifices led Germany's leaders to formulate war aims to cover the costs of the war. The German regime knew that to stay in power they would have to buy off the domestic opposition after the war. The enormous costs of the war gave the regime only two options. They could buy off the people with real political concessions, specifically a reform of the Prussian franchise and the introduction of parliamentary government. Alternatively, they could buy off the people with the spoils of a victorious war. The German regime could not grant political concessions to the opposition without endangerng their own political survival. That left them only one possibility to buy off the opposition: gains at the expense of their external enemies, in other words, high war aims./

- By early 1917, the German leaders have grown ever more pessimistic of the outcome of the war. It's this pessimism that pushed them to go for the high risk strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
- The infamous Zimmerman telegram was also a manifestation of such pessimism. They wouldn't have considered pulling in Mexico to their side if the German leadership was confident of their capability to win the war swiftly.

  /Germany's increased territorial demands at the end of 1916, such as the additional land demanded from Poland, were intended to reward the populace in the form of land grants and settlements. Other demands, such as increased economic penetration of Poland and Austria-Hungary, the treaty of commerce with Russia, the exploitation of Belgian mineral resources, and compensations for German losses in other countries, were intended to prevent higher postwar taxes and, through a stronger economy, improved wages./
#+end_quote

- The author argued that Hindenburg's reputation was used as an insurance for their war aims. Hindenburg, though himself taking on extremist positions in terms of war conduct and aims, is considered a competent leader across the political spectrum, not just among conservatives but also among the moderates. This meant that in the event Hindenburg has to endorse a "meager peace", his reputation alone would be enough to convince the populace to accept such outcome.
- Russia is classified as mixed regime. It's authoritarian in theory, but by the beginning of the 20th century Imperial Russia has become an inefficient police state, unable to effectively stave off widespread opposition at times.
- Even before the war, Russian leadership was aware that they have slim chances of suppressing a peasant revolution. As war went on, they increased war aims as a way to capture popular support, to no avail. By 1916, it was clear that war defeat would result in a revolution that topples the Tsarist regime, and they will hardly be able to prevent such a scenario.
- French Third Republic political makeup is kinda similar in the Philippines today lol. Politicians switch alliances when convenient, and there's a ton or parties in the Parliament, making it a very pluralistic system. The stability of the Third Republic is that successive Cabinets featured the same set of personalities over and over.

  /Compared to Germany, there was little reason to fear a socialist revolution in France. Not only was the existing nonexclusionary structure willing to co-opt individual socialists and socialist ideas, the basis of socialist support was also much weaker./

  /The pronounced democratic nature of prewar French politics and the democratic slack in the policy-making process prevented a zero-sum view of domestic politics among the great majority of Frenchmen.

  /There hardly can be any doubt that the mutinies presented French leaders with some unpleasant new information: French relative strength and cost tolerance were lower than they had previously estimated. The French army was simply not willing to lose so much blood for so few expected gains./

  /In the period between May-June and November 1917, a deep feeling of depression spread over France. With the repeated promises that victory was near and that the next offensive would be the last now totally discredited, the French populace became unwilling to bear quietly any longer the privations imposed by the war./
#+end_quote

- By early 1918, the French public actually has more information about an vimpending German offensive than the Geman populace themselves.
- Overall, throughout the war the French government was more worried about international consequences rather than domestic ones. France was more concerned with the balance of powers in Europe and beyond, and less on how the people themselves would react to either victory or defeat.
- Initial French war aims included the return of Alsace-Lorraine's 1790 borders. As war went on, and as pessimism crept in, the demand was revised down to 1870 Alsace-Lorraine, which had substantially smaller portion of the Saar coalfields.
- Author countered the argument that Alsace-Lorraine was used to buy off the populace and prevent popular unrest. The author argued that there was no major popular pressure from any sector to recover the region. Or rather, the French government did not feel significant threat of overthrow due to an inability to take Alsace-Lorraine. The region's primary significance is strategic and economic, and pressure from below did not affect such considerations.

#+begin_quote
  /In France neither the opposition from the right, mainly supporters of the army and the Church, nor the socialist opposition from the left posed a real threat to the survival of the French regime. It is not surprising, then, that war aims never became a central issue in the domestic political struggle. Demands for rewards for the sacrifices imposed by the war could be met by relatively minor domestic political concessions./
#+end_quote

- Another proof that the French government did not face threat of domestic revolution is that none of the Prime Ministers throughout the war sought to stay in power. In fact, there have been five such Prime Ministers during the conflict, from varying parties, and in any case any attempt to perpetuate in power would have been checked by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
- British Empire is tagged as Democracy. While suffrage is far from universal - it's only for men who own property - the populace is generally well represented in Parliament. And unlike in Germany, British Parliament has actual policy-making powers.

  /In essence, and especially with regard to foreign policy, the King could take no position that had not been previously agreed upon or that was not in harmony with the policy of his government.

  /British war aims were formulated to contain not just the Central Powers but also Britain's wartime allies. This dynamic was a crucial factor in the government's reluctance to discuss its war aims in the first place and helped keep those aims vague./

- Britain wanted to maximize American participation to their advantage by pursuing amalgamation: keep the American forces plenty enough to cover manpower shortages, but small enough that the US cannot have greater influence in possible postwar bargaining. The author then notes that at one point in late 1917, Britain had little problem bringing in 500k American troops to Europe when necessity came up.
- The British government proved willing to make domestic concessions to aid the conduct of war. In particular, mass conscription was supplemented with universal suffrage and large scale social welfare programs that extended beyond the war.
- Britain was very concerned about international consequences of the war, and their status as a great power. The British are afraid of Germany being vindicated for violating Belgian neutrality, and its precedence for further German imperial designs in Europe. But also, the British were fearful that Russia's victory over the Ottoman Empire would be a major threat to the British Raj, while also throwing off the balance of power in the Mediterranean.

#+begin_quote
  /Ludendorff preferred to fight on in an almost hopeless cause, even to lose the war, rather than to reform the Prussian franchise. In sharp contrast, Britain's leaders were willing to more than double the franchise because they never feared such concessions would mean the irrevocable overthrow of the old system.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /It is striking to note how the British were willing to offer the very thing the German leaders wanted to avoid at all costs: a far-reaching reform of the franchise. This willingness to offer concessions, seen in combination with Britain's prewar political difficulties, clearly shows that it is indeed regime type and not the presence or absence of prewar crises that caused the different reactions to unfavorable new information of Germany and Britain. While Germany increased its war aims to cover the costs of war, Britain lowered its war aims./

- Lenin knew that Russian Army has become too weak to fight, and continuing the war will inevitably result in massive Russian defeat and collapse of the newly-established Soviet state. He instead banked on a future reversal of fortunes.
- For their part, Germany could've extracted more favorable terms from Brest-Litovsk. They chose not to, and tried to settle the treaty sooner. This is because they desperately need to transfer a vast amount of troops to the Western Front, and pressing for more demands will just further delay the mobilization plans.
- On the other hand, Germany did not try to offer peace with the Western Allies because they need the higher war aims to cover the costs of war and buy off domestic opposition. Ludendorff has also already been planning new offensives on the West at the time of Brest-Litovsk, and he wanted to make the gamble that the offensive could give Germany a victory and better position to bargain.

#+begin_quote
  /The pressures from the individual states and the industrialists to maintain the domestic political balance of power were largely responsible for the leadership's continued insistence on high war aims in the west and, therefore, for the decision to launch an offensive in the spring of 1918./

#+begin_quote
  /The unfavorable new information on the last days of September forced the German leadership to draw two unpleasant conclusions. First, defeat in the war was now inevitable.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /A bargaining space was finally created in October and November because the German regime realized the war was inevitbaly lost. No more high-variance strategies could conceivably save them. The only way now to avoid severe domestic punishment was to make peace as soon a spossible and institute domestic political reforms through a revolution from above in order to "save what could be saved." France, Britain, and the United States meanwhile increased their demands but stopped (just barely) short of asking for unconditional surrender—even though the Germans would have accepted—because of intra-alliance pressures and fears the others would gain most from continued was while they would have to pay most of the costs./

  /The armistice agreement was finally signed at 5:10 in the morning.

* WORLDMAKING IN THE LONG GREAT WAR
** /Jonathan Wyrtzen/

#+begin_quote
  /The conventional 1914–1918 World War I bracket is limited by two entwined biases that distort our overall understanding of the conflict and warp it in specific ways with respect to the Middle East. The first is a bias toward a judicial definition of wartime that is bookended by the dates of formal declarations, armistices, and treaties carried out by recognized state actors. Using this shorthand occludes complicated realities of continuing violence and political fluidity that extend beyond those dates. The second bias is a myopic privileging of the beginning and ending of hostilities in a single theater of the war to periodize the whole of the conflict. In this case, fixating on the Western Front diverts attention from what was happening in the conflict’s other interconnected maritime and overland theaters, minimizing the true interregional scope of World War I./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /De-Europeanizing the Great War by Ottomanizing it underscores how the greater Middle East was central to the causes, course of, and outcomes of World War I as a whole. For Middle East history, thinking in terms of a Long Great War offers an essential framework for identifying, analyzing, and interpreting the complicated processes through which the region’s political order was unmade, reimagined, and remade in a period that extends beyond that conventional dating./
#+end_quote

- The book is focused on the Middle East and North Africa for periodizing the First World War. Interestingly, Morocco is used for anchoring both the start (1911) and end (1934) of the Long Great War.
- The author scrutinizes and rejects the standard Sykes-Picot narrative. Notes that it exemplifies the usual problem with periodizing the War to 1914-1918: the narrative assumes that treaties are ironclad and reflect realities on the ground (they don't).

#+begin_quote
  /At its core, it leans heavily on the judicial fallacy already discussed: wartime agreements and postwar treaties are presumed to actually do work, converting more or less directly into realities on the ground. Narrating a progression of discrete events in this way, however, glosses over major gaps between aspirations and reality, concealing the complex and contingent processes actually happening over time./
#+end_quote

- Sykes-Picot narrative emphasizes three overlapping British promises: to the Arabs; to the French; and to the Zionist movement. In this narrative, the central problem is with the British reneging on their promise to the Arabs.

#+begin_quote
  /Political space, including territorial space, is always produced by political actors—in this case by both local and colonial actors struggling over the region’s future. None of the modern polities or borders in the greater Middle East were unilaterally imposed; all were negotiated over time; and virtually all were actually defined and demarcated, not with the stroke of a pen, but extended periods of warfare./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /At its core, this book’s counternarrative focuses on how war unmakes political orders and how it provides the conditions in which new political worlds can be made. It traces how three integral processes of this worldmaking—state formation, political identity formation, and territorial boundary formation—shaped the modern Middle East. In this account, interactions involving and entangling international and local actors drove these entwined, but distinct, processes. European colonial powers are neither all powerful nor absent but, rather, provincialized as one set among many contributing actors, including a cast of local leaders and movements, whose power also had potentials and limits./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The political boundaries of the modern Middle East, too, were remade through war, not secret agreements or the peace settlement.

  /The two Moroccan crises demonstrated an increasing and dangerous willingness by the European powers to pair colonial competition in the greater Ottoman sphere with military saber-rattling on the continent. These interactions also clarified and solidified the emerging lines of alliance that would shape the Great War./

- Author notes that Germany's first attack against French forces wasn't in mainland Europe, but in Algeria. RMS Breslau and Goeben attacked embarkation ports on 3 August 1914 to prevent transfer of French troops from Africa to Europe.
- Crucially, these two ships would later also cause the official entry of Ottoman Empire to the conflict, when they entered the Dardanelles and transferred command to the Ottoman Navy.
- By start of 1915, the Ottomans would suffer a major defeat in the Caucasus, in a battle lead by Enver Pasha against the Russians. This defeat would be blamed on Armenians, and would be a catalyst to the genocide presided over by the Ottoman government.
- Long before the discovery of oil in Mesopotamia, the British Empire already has protected interests in the region. Mainly, control of Mesopotamia ensured dominance in shipping, as well as keeping other powers such as Russia far from the British Raj.

  /The Ottoman Empire faced a multifronted struggle, on their own territory, to a degree unique among the belligerents in World War I, most of whom only had one or two active military theaters. On almost all of these fronts, the Ottomans were able, remarkably, to hold their own./

- The Ottoman fronts were:
  - Caucasus
  - Dardanelles
  - Mesopotamia
  - Northern Africa
  - Greater Syria via Sinai

  /In the Middle East, the war had required total mobilization of the general population, which had suffered tremendously because of food shortages exacerbated by the Allied blockade and the horrific purges of suspect populations, forced resettlement, and genocide of Armenian and Assyrian populations  the empire. On each of the fighting fronts discussed—in the Caucasus and eastern Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Northern Africa, and in Arabia and Syria—the way the war played out transformed political horizons. Rather than being fixed, these boundaries of collective political solidarity were in tremendous flux within the fluid post-armistice environment./

- The people within Greater Syria region are well aware of foreign plans for partitioning the Middle East. In particular, details about the Balfour Declaration and the Sykes-Picot agreement spread across the region after the Bolshevik government declassified war-related treaties and accords.
- The 1919 King-Crane Commission showed that: majority of the population in Greater Syrian region favored independence; that they were wary, even opposed, to the Zionist program put forward by the European powers; and that the British and the French are asserting their mandate over these peoples.
- By 1919, the most popular plan among the peoples of Greater Syria is a unified Arab monarchy under King Faisal. A second option is still unified Syria, but under American supervision.
- Armenian and Kurdish delegations received sympathetic audience in Paris. However, very little was done on the ground to address their concerns.
- The Allies partitioned Anatolia among themselves, and Greek forces also moved on their own to occupy Izmir. Resistance to continued Allied occupation was organized and lead by Mustafa Kemal.
- The Syrian Congress declared independence on 8 May 1920, with King Faisal as head of state. The French forces moved to quell the independece movement, and in a few months ousted Faisal and gained control over Greater Syria, placing it under French mandate.

  /The cost of imposing the mandate in Iraq had been high, with six thousand Iraqi lives lost and five hundred British and Indian soldiers. Monetarily it cost the British one hundred million pounds in direct and indirect costs, five times the budgeted annual allotment for the whole mandate administration. On the Iraqi side, the experience of mobilization, military confrontation, and brutal suppression up and down the Tigris and Euphrates, though still largely local, also strengthened a nascent larger collective solidarity./

- Unlike with the rest of the Middle East, only one European power staked claims on the Arabian peninsula: the British Empire. The conflict in the region will be between proxies of two British political groups.
- The Cairo Office supported Sharif Husayn of Hejaz. The India Office supported Ibn Saud of the Najd. The Paris Conference ultimately recognized Sharif Husayn's Kingdom of Hejaz.

  /Much more than the infamous Sykes-Picot Agreement, it was in the League of Nations–ratified Sèvres treaty that the European powers actually drew lines on the map, negotiated which colonial power got what, and determined which local claims were recognized over others. As a “final” settlement, however, the article-by-article peace terms set out on paper and signed that August glossed over the complex, continuing wartime interactions in the region that were, even at the moment the treaty was being signed, rapidly making the treaty terms a dead letter./

- Egypt became the British launch point for Ottoman campaigns. The country and its people felt that their heavy involvement and sacrifices in the War should be reciprocated with independence.
- The arrest of Egyptian delegation sparked massive protests and anti-British attacks. The British carefully considered their predicament, and ultimately relented, giving Egypt nominal independence on 22 February 1922.

  /Though settled in international law, Morocco was far from a settled polity on the ground. The French, Spanish, and Alawites (the Moroccan dynasty) were all far from exercising much actual state control, and Morocco itself was far from even being a clearly defined territorial entity. The “Morocco” cursorily referred to in the Sèvres treaty had been split up in 1912 in complicated ways among French, Spanish, and international (around Tangier) zones, but these zones’ actual boundaries remained fuzzy./

- France and Spain maintained their respective areas of control in Morocco. The French side has a more centralized lowlands region including Rabat, and a mountainous region where they are content with loose control over the tribes.
- Spanish troops, after the War, pushed to establish control over the mountainous regions in their zone. This ignited uprising among the tribes, which united under the leadership of Mohamed bin Abd el-Krim.
- The Spanish were repeatedly pushed back, suffering massive defeats, and even French cooperation was not enough. In early 1920s Abd el-Krim lead the creation of al-Jumhuriyya al-Riffia, the Rif Republic.

  /The Arabian Peninsula was one of the few places in the greater Middle East in which there was no European colonial state in formation attempting to directly reshape the postwar map. A British zone of influence in the peninsula was internationally accepted (though Italy made a play for influence in Yemen), yet within this zone, outside of the Aden Protectorate (established in 1839), the British acted more as a referee than an active player in struggles amongst multiple local emerging polities./

  /The onset of the war, the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, and the increase of revenue and support streams from external sources had made new political visions thinkable for multiple local actors in the Arabian Peninsula. These included the Hashemites in the Hejaz, the Rashidis in Ha’il, the Saudis in the Najd, the Sabbagh family in Kuwait, the various emirates between Kuwait and Oman, the Idrissid amir in Asir, and the Imam in Yemen. In stark contrast to other regions where local emerging polities (like the Rif or Sanusi proto-states) had to compete against European colonial states, in Arabia they had to compete with each other./

- Turkey and Soviet Russia sorted their claims in the Caucasian region through the Treaty of Moscow in 1921. Later that year, Turkey reaffirmed the boundaries together with Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, in the Treaty of Kars.
- To bolster his revolution against the European powers, Mustafa Kemal initially emphasized Turkish pluralism, where Turks, Kurds, and other ethnic groups are united against their conquerors.
- Once the Republic of Turkey has established itself, however, Kemal and his government pivoted to Turkish homogenization and suppression of ethnic pluralism, asserting the use of Turkish language throughout the country inlcuding in Kurdistan.
- Kemal's vision for Turkey began with multiethnic Islamic country, but later evolved to become Turkish nationalist secular republic.
- Both Turkey and Britain laid claim on Kurdistan, and mobilized their own Kurdish factions to vie control for the region. Turkey's suppression of Kurdish sympathies in its border ultimately worked against them, as the League of Nations deemed it better to give Mosul to British-controlled Iraq instead.
- By 1925, the Rif Repulic was able to establish infrastructure to assert its territorial integrity, stationing border and customs guards and building some usable road networks.
- Abd el-Krim also recognized the significance of international recognition, and employed diplomatic means to assert and gain support for independence. This diplomatic campaign indeed garnered support from all over the world.
- Combined French and Spanish forces gradually broke through the Rif Republic, and Abd el-Krim surrendered in 1926, though he also encouraged individual tribes to continue resistance. The Rif Republic was finally suppressed in 1927.
- European powers honed their aerial warfare capabilities in the Middle East, where planes were greatly used against the various rebel forces in the region.

  /The war drove transformational state, collective identity, and boundary-making processes for all the parties involved. The extended wartime experience has for generations since shaped notions of collective identity. The Rif resistance also fired the imagination of urban and rural communities elsewhere in Morocco for anticolonial struggle that would take various forms over subsequent decades. For the Spanish and French, the threat of the Rif Republic forced massive mobilization and massive expenditures to extend the reach of the colonial states in their respective zones. It was also in and through the exigencies of total colonial war that spatializing technologies like cartography, surveying, aerial photography, physical occupation, and scientific surveying had to be deployed to delineate and monopolize state space in the rugged interior terrain of northern Morocco./

  /These nearly synchronic Kurdish, Riffi, and Syrian jihads—the term most of their participants used to refer to these struggles—launched in the spring and summer of 1925 gave lie to any presumption that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne had finally crystallized the post-Ottoman political order of the modern Middle East. The Lausanne treaty officially recognized the dramatic transformations the Turkish Republic had achieved, but, as with Sèvres, there still remained a huge gap between the treaty terms and still unsettled political realities in eastern Anatolia, Greater Syria, and Northwest Africa. At friction points across the region, viable colonial and local polities that emerged in the wake of the fall of the Ottoman Empire continued to clash in crescendoing waves of large-scale military conflict in the mid and late 1920s./

- Ibn Saud and his Ikhwan allies disagreed on the nature of their territorial borders. The former wanted well-defined borders, the latter want continuous expansions. Ibn Saud used this conflict to consolidate power and fully expand his territory to encompass the Arabian peninsula. In 1932, Ibn Saud established his consolidated state's identity as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
- Ibn Saud has incurred large debt from the wars he fought in the creation of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To pay for these, he forged an oil agreement with Standard Oil, marking the start of the Kingdom’s petroleum industry, that continues to shape the Middle East to this day.

  /By the mid-1930s, the region-wide period of sustained wartime catalyzed in 1911 by French and Italian expansion into Northern Africa, which had unmade the previous political order from Morocco to Iran and through which the greater Middle East was remade into an interstate system of local and colonial polities, drew to a close. Though the region would again soon be swept up into another world war and tumultuous struggles for decolonization, none of these conflicts would fundamentally transform the political topography reimagined and forged through the Long Great War./

  /By tracing out how the Long Great War unmade political worlds and served as the crucible in which new political worlds were imagined and put in motion, this book’s alternate narrative has shown that the new map of the modern Middle East was not imposed but reshaped over time as rival colonial and local clashed violently into the 1920s and 1930s. States, identities, and spatial boundaries were transformed through war, not a peace settlement./

  /The Sykes-Picot myth primes us presuppositionally with an intuitive Edenic counterfactual in which “natural” borders could have been drawn but were transgressed. The implicit assumption is that some sort of primordial post-Ottoman ethnonational communities in fact existed and were spatially bounded, and, by extension, that the colonial and local actors had fixed ideas and preferences that were diametrically opposed. This ignores the historical record, traced throughout this book, of colonial and local actors repeatedly recalculating and reimagining new political futures, with adjusted social and physical boundaries, based on opportunity contexts that shifted as competing projects came into conflict and new facts on the ground were established./

  /What the European colonial powers did wrong was to repeatedly, persistently, and violently intervene, shaping the region’s political institutions by buttressing authoritarian colonial state structures whose legacies continue to impact the modern Middle East. In sum, if you are going to assign blame, don’t blame the borders—blame the politics and political systems colonial powers crushed or reinforced within the borders./

  /What the British did wrong was to pursue an ambivalent, at times schizophrenic, ethnoreligious divide-and-rule policy in which they never midwifed representative political structures through which a Palestinian Jewish and Arab unified polity could emerge. Instead, they helped birth a zero-sum game of competitive Zionist and Palestinian nation-building that continues, with brutal human costs, to the present./

  /It is important to not veer too far toward naively idealizing the self-determining political futures that “might have been” across the region. History rarely offers up black and white stories with clear good and bad guys; the Long Great War framework, which itself contains multiple counterfactuals to the Sykes-Picot narrative, shows us how much the making of the modern Middle East is a study in greys./

#+begin_quote
  /But, in finally forgoing the myth that the region’s "Fall" is because of the original sin of imposed, artificial borders, we can  that the Middle East is neither perpetually cursed by the Great War legacy nor think that its salvation lies in either external powers or local actors simply redrawing these boundaries. The deeper issue is political. Being able to see how new worlds were created in the Middle East in the Long Great War helps us see that they can be reimagined and remade now and in the future—and therein lies hope./
