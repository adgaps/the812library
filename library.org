* AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS
** /Alan Taylor/

- Contrary to how it's often depicted, the American Revolutionary War wasn't a clear-cut conflict of patriotic Americans against the British. Such a view is meant to prop up nationalistic feelings and emphasize the unity of the thirteen colonies.
- In reality, as the author argues, the Revolutionary War was a bloody conflict of an almost civil war-like character.

#+begin_quote
  /Only by the especially destructive standards of other revolutions was the American more restrained. During the Revolutionary War, Americans killed one another over politics and massacred Indians, who returned the bloody favors. Patriots also kept one-fifth of Americans enslaved, and thousands of those slaves escaped to help the British oppose the revolution. After the war, 60,000 dispossessed Loyalists became refugees. The dislocated proportion of the American population exceeded that of the French in their revolution. The American revolutionary turmoil also inflicted an economic decline that lasted for fifteen years in a crisis unmatched until the Great Depression of the 1930s. During the revolution, Americans suffered more upheaval than any other American generation, save that which experienced the Civil War of 1861 to 1865./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By writing of the American Revolution as pitting “Americans” against the British, historians prematurely find a cohesive, national identity. If we equate Patriots with Americans, we recycle the canard that anyone who opposed the revolution was an alien at heart. We also read American nationalism backwards, obscuring the divisions and uncertainties of the revolutionary era./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /But that upheaval also generated political and cultural creativity. Indeed, the accomplishments of independence, union, and republican government seem all the more remarkable given the grim civil war at the heart of the revolution. The founders had formidable enemies, internal divisions, and their own doubts, fears, and contentions to overcome. If they fell short in producing equality and liberty for all, they established ideals worth striving for./
#+end_quote

- The book also takes a more "Atlantic" and "Continental" approach, instead of the conventional narrative that focuses on the East.

#+begin_quote
  /The founders of the American union understood that they were enmeshed in global networks of trade, culture, diplomacy, and war. As they expected, their actions affected, and were affected by, the rest of the world./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /During the early eighteenth century, the colonies and Britain became more closely intertwined in a shared empire in which political, economic, cultural, and military initiatives came from the great metropolis of London. Imperial success in war and restraint in politics led colonial leaders to glory in the identity of transplanted Englishmen endowed with the same liberties enjoyed by their peers in the mother country. Rather than thinking of themselves as a distinct new people in America, colonists claimed the status of Britons who lived west of the Atlantic./
#+end_quote

- Slave trade and slavery became highly profitable, and millions of Africans were brought to the American colonies in the process. The colonists had little regard for the slaves' welfare, as they could be easily replaced upon death. Their living conditions were intentionally kept abysmal to lower costs.
- In Spanish America, slaves had relatively better standing, and racial hierarchy was less sharp and more fluid. This is due to combination of Roman law, the Catholic Church's influence, and the long history of racial mixing.
- The upper class in British America were known as the "genteel", form which the term "gentleman" (genteel man) derives from.
  
#+begin_quote
  /In the established churches, ministers preached the sacredness of social stability and deference to a hierarchy of authority./

  /Colonial churches assigned pews on the basis of family status, with the most prestigious people sitting closest to the minister. That insistence on ranking and order derived from a pervasive anxiety over status competition and social mobility in British America./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By emphasizing the overwhelming, miraculous, and fundamental power of God acting directly and indiscriminately upon souls, evangelicals weakened the social conventions of their hierarchical society. By insisting that everyone had the right to choose his or her own minister, evangelicals championed individualism, a concept then considered divisive and anarchic. Free choice had radical implications for an unequal society in which husbands commanded wives, fathers dictated to sons, masters owned servants and slaves, and gentlemen claimed deference from common people. Evangelicals argued that no worldly authority should obstruct religious choice, and they charged that great wealth and power rendered men too proud to humble themselves before God: the prerequisite for salvation by a new birth./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Rejecting the traditional conviction that society should unite under one church, evangelicals promoted a more pluralistic, egalitarian, and voluntary social order. Their itinerant preachers and converts sought freely to cross community and denominational lines. The evangelical style influenced the younger ministers in established churches, for they had to compete to retain parishioners, who liked to sample a range of preachers. Evangelical values prepared many colonists to seek a new society premised on individualism and voluntary association./
#+end_quote

- The colonies were supposed to be mirrored from the mainland British political system, where a monarch rules over a parliament divided into two chambers: for the aristocrats (House of Lords) and for the general populace (House of Commons). The colonies, for this purpose, have an appointed governor, a council, and a representative assembly.
- In reality, this system barely functioned the way intended. Governors rule for only a few years and scarcely familiar with their constituencies. The councilors did not hold as much wealth and influence as titled aristocrats in Britain. The assemblies held disproportionately greater power, as a larger percentage of people have properties compared with mainland Britain.

#+begin_quote
  /Britons and British Americans shared an identity defined against the Catholic French and Spanish, cast as economically backward, religiously superstitious, culturally decadent, and submissive to despotic rule. By contrast, Britons felt especially blessed and enlightened by commerce, civil liberties, the common law, and their Protestant faith./
#+end_quote

- Though the British won the Seven Years War, it came at the cost of getting saddled by higher colonial expenses and increased debt.

#+begin_quote
  /After the triumphant war, colonists expected a privileged position as Britons in America. Instead, to their horror, imperial reformers sought a more centralized empire./
#+end_quote

- The Pontiac Rebellion further hardened colonist sentiment against the natives. The colonists retaliated and on several instances massacred native Indians.

#+begin_quote
  /British officers concluded that settlers, rather than Indians, posed the greatest threat to imperial peace and order on the frontier. Determined to avoid another expensive war, British officials sought to protect natives from settlers. While colonists drew a harder racial line against Indians, Britons felt a new sympathy for them./

  /But colonists longed to crush and dispossess native peoples, if only the British would get out of the way./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Natives reserved most of their domains for hunting game and gathering roots, herbs, and berries. Men hunted, fished, and built cabins, while women tended crops of corn, beans, and squash planted near their  villages. Lacking courts, jails, bureaucracies, and professional armies, the Indian nations were communities of extended kin. Native nations subdivided into many scattered villages, each with several, competing chiefs who led rival clans. Natives preferred dispersed, weak, and competitive leadership as the best guarantor of their cherished freedom./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Imperial officials blamed unregulated expansion and land speculation for provoking expensive Indian wars and clashes between landlords and settlers. Imperialists also distrusted colonial leaders who benefited from speculation and expansion. Lacking aristocratic origins, leading colonists were relative upstarts and strivers apparently driven by greed and ambition to defy any restraints sought by the empire./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Imperial measures seemed to threaten the landed interests and ambitions of leading colonists, but the Crown lacked the means to enforce its reforms. By withdrawing troops from the backcountry while escalating its pretensions to control settlers and speculators, the British created a credibility gap. Imperial measures combined potential threat with real impotence. That combination rendered the empire irritating yet contemptible to colonists who wanted to profit from westward expansion./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Patriots struggled against the double challenge of British taxes and popular discontent. They dreaded losing power over the common colonists to an empire that seized control over revenue and access to frontier land. Worse still, a triumphant empire might deploy Indian allies as frontier enforcers. Although the empire was, in fact, losing that control, its robust pretensions sufficed to scare Patriots into uniting to complete the collapse of imperial authority in the West, where farms, fortunes, and futures were made./
#+end_quote

- Even in the early 18th century there have already been rumblings about the British Parliament imposing its authority over colonists' assemblies, which the latter hold to be co-equal with the former.
- Taxes on sugar have been enforced by Parliament on the colonies in the 18th century, but the general response has been muted resentment from the colonists. There was an assumption that another tax could be passed and the opposition will still remain minimal. So in 1765, Parliament passed a stamp tax for the colonies.
- The stamp tax instead garnered widespread anger and protests. The colonies are still reeling from postwar depression, and many people are already saddled with economic hardships.

#+begin_quote
  /British leaders had expected little resistance from the diverse mainland colonies with their deep suspicions of one another. But the Stamp Act touched a raw nerve, their aversion to taxes imposed by Parliament, so the crisis generated unprecedented intercolonial communication and cooperation./
#+end_quote

- Colonists appealed to King George III for help to rein in Parliament. The King sacked PM Grenville, and in 1766 Parliament repealed the stamp tax.
- On the other hand, as they repealed the tax, Parliament also issued a Declaratory Act, which asserts their sovereign authority over the colonies. The repeal of the tax was widely celebrated in the colonies; the Declaratory Act was received with minimal fanfare.
- Subsequent tax on some imported goods also garnered widespread protest. This time, boycotts were enforced by a riotous group known as Songs of Liberty, which resorted to violence and intimidation to prevent the trading of boycotted goods.
- The import duties were subsequently repealed, except for tea. For the most part, this was received with minimal protesting. Consumers largely circumvented this by going for smuggled tea from the Dutch East Indies instead.
- Parliament tried to undercut the smuggling by imposing smaller taxes for tea from the British East India Company. This angered the merchants who make money from the smuggled tea. A mob boarded a Company ship docked in Boston port and dumped all its tea on the waters.
- In 1774, Patriot leaders gathered in Philadelphia to convene a First Continental Congress, which coordinated response against the British. The Congress formed a mass boycott system called Continental Association. Towns were called to form their committees of inspection that identified people who refuse to follow the boycott.
- The Continental Association resulted in violators being shamed and intimidated, and townsfolk were encouraged to police their neighbors to make sure they comply with the boycott.

#+begin_quote
  /Patriots defended freedom for white men while asserting their domination over enslaved blacks. Patriots understood that dominion in defensive terms, as meant to secure their liberty and property from slaves allegedly manipulated by the British. In the South, the enslaved sought a greater revolution, for they meant to “Alter the World” and regarded Britons, rather than Patriots, as the better champions of true liberty. Although the British performance as liberators lagged far behind the wishful hopes of the enslaved, they could find no better ally./
#+end_quote

- Despite the open armed conflict between the Patriots and the Loyalists, well into 1776 the Continental Congress still rejected independence. Thomas Paine's pamphlet, Common Sense, was instrumental in swaying the Patriots to the side of independence.

#+begin_quote
  /Unlike previous political pamphleteers who wrote in a learned and legalistic style, Paine addressed common people in direct and forceful prose./

  /Avoiding the arcane works of political philosophers, Paine quoted only the Bible: the primary text known and revered by his intended readers. For Paine, style was also substance, for he sought to constitute a new readership: a broad and engaged public for a republican revolution. He insisted that common people should no longer defer to gentlemen in politics. Aptly titled, Common Sense spoke to and for common people./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Paine pushed for immediate independence, a union of thirteen states, and republican governments for those states. All three goals broke dramatically with past experience and received wisdom. No colonies in the Americas had yet revolted from their mother empire; past bickering by the colonies augured poorly for a union; and almost all former republics in Europe had been small, contentious, and short-lived. In a daring stroke, Paine argued that Americans could triumph by combining all three gambles: on independence, union, and republic. Seeking one alone would certainly fail, but the combination would prove invincible. If united in a righteous cause, he insisted, Americans could crush the corrupt mercenaries of a royal tyrant./
#+end_quote

- Of the thirteen colonies, twelve voted for independence on 2 July 1776. New York initially abstained, but voted in favor a week later.
- The Declaration of Independence was formally adopted and published on 4 July 1776. It was ordered disseminated, and the document itself being short enough to fit a newpaper page helped publishing it much easier.

#+begin_quote
  /A popular myth casts the revolution as waged by a united American people against British rule. That myth derives from Patriot claims to speak for all true Americans, dismissing Loyalists as a deluded few corrupted by the British./

  /After the revolution triumphed, nationalist historians endorsed the Patriot view, marginalizing or ignoring Loyalists to concoct a unifying American identity. In fact, the revolution divided families and neighborhoods./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Revolutions breed civil wars: triangular struggles in which two sides compete for civilian support./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By sorting Americans into Loyalists and Patriots, we suggest that individuals made quick and definitive decisions based on political principles. Some did, but many more committed slowly, reluctantly, and provisionally./

  /Choosing sides in a civil war was painful and confusing for rural folk, who rarely read a pamphlet or saw a newspaper. People balked at the risks of clear allegiance: exposing their farms to looters, suffering the hardships of a military camp or political prison, or killing others and risking death in combat./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Political choices were often unstable and temporary. The ebb and flow of victory and defeat in a long war flipped many people from one side to another and sometimes back again with sojourns along the way in the broad ranks of the wavering. Many profited by selling their produce or services to the likely victors: a probability which changed as one force surged at the expense of the other. More often, people acted defensively, switching sides to save farms and lives from the power of the ascendant party./
#+end_quote

- People were intimidated, pressured, threatened, even killed, for simply being neutral, or just being disaffected and not wanting to get into the conflict.
- The author is really trying to drive home the point that the Patriots demanded unity under their banner and rooted out opposition, by hook and by crook.

#+begin_quote
  /Popular history books dwell on the big battles between formal armies and treat the conflict as relatively restrained. That approach neglects the broader and more vicious war conducted by many small raiding parties, composed of a mix of regulars and irregulars, militia and bandits. They ravaged farms and towns to take forage, livestock, clothing, and silver, and they kidnapped or killed the partisans of the other side./
#+end_quote

- Even prior to the Revolutionary Wars, the colonists already have a tense relationship with the native Indian settlers especially in the west of the 13 colonies. The colonists sought to push westwards little by little, laying claim on native lands for speculation.
- The war further deteriorated the situation, as many Indian tribes sided with the Europeans. This also amde the colonists more determined to stamp out the Indian settlements once and for all.

#+begin_quote
  /Spain’s empire remained overstretched and internally volatile. Like the British, the Spanish had imposed reforms meant to rationalize and centralize control, undermining the local power long enjoyed by elite colonists. Unlike the British, the Spanish succeeded in imposing their taxes, more than doubling Crown revenues. Emboldened by success, imperial rulers issued grandiose dictates, which commanded colonial officials to impose tighter control over natives and colonists./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /While waging war in the east against British rule, Patriots fought west of the Appalachians to suppress the independence of native peoples. Patriots meant to create an “empire of liberty” premised on the ability of common whites to obtain private property by taking land from Indians./

  /Jefferson understood the paradoxical lesson that had eluded the British: an empire in America could only hope to appear strong by facilitating the wishes of its citizens, who wanted cheap and fertile land taken as quickly as possible from natives. American leaders needed to ride, rather than resist, the settler wave heading west. While the revolution had western roots, it would also bear western consequences but only after a generous peace treaty rescued the United States./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The French and Spanish could sustain larger forces in the Caribbean in part because they more readily enlisted and armed free blacks. These empires also had more free blacks to recruit because the Catholic church and their laws encouraged manumissions. A quarter of the blacks in Spanish America were free, compared to less than a twentieth in the British West Indies. More pragmatic in tincturing their racism, the Spanish and French recognized that an armed and intermediary caste of free blacks tended to secure, rather than imperil, the slave system. Struggling to defend their islands, Britons paid a premium to cling to especially rigid racial prejudices./
#+end_quote

- The war left the French with negligible benefits, and saddled them with large debts. The crisis caused by the national debt would lead to the convening of the Estates General in 1789, and will set in motion two decades of war and revolution in Europe.
- When the Revolutionary Wars ended, there was suspicion spread by the British that Washington would rule as a military dictator, like Julius Caesar and Cromwell. Instead, in 1783 Washington voluntarily resigned his commission before the Congress in Annapolis, Maryland.
- After the Wars, Loyalist refugees were violently prevented from resettling into the 13 colonies. They dispersed throughout the other remaining colonies especially in British Canada.
- In 1781, the thirteen colonies agreed to establish a confederation, the United States of America. The centralizing Congress, however, had little authority over the individual states, which retained their powers.

#+begin_quote
  /Fertile but roiled by violence, the West fed both short-term pessimism and long-term optimism for the American union. In the vast, western lands drained by navigable rivers, Americans detected a great source of wealth and power. But Indians defended those lands, and federal leaders struggled to control their own settlers. In sum, the West promised either to enrich or to unravel the fragile union./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Thomas Jefferson drafted the first “Northwest Ordinance,” which Congress provisionally adopted in April 1784. It subdivided the federal domain into ten territories and stipulated that, once any one had 20,000 free citizens, they could convene a convention to draft a republican constitution and send a delegate to Congress. When the settler population reached the threshold of the smallest original state, Rhode Island, the territory could join the union as an equal partner in its powers and share in the national debt. While holding out future statehood, the ordinance bought time for the federal government to sell land within the territories./
#+end_quote

- The fledgling United States' desire to push westwards pitted the newly-settled Americans in the Federal domain against the native Indians. The Congress was too weak and powerless to diffuse the tensions between the warring settlers and natives. In addition, British and Spanish colonies also checked the United States' expansionist policies.
  
#+begin_quote
  /Republicanism inflated the aspirations of common men, who grumbled when wealthy gentlemen continued to grab the largest land grants, top commands, highest offices, and best contracts. Common folk also bore the greatest sacrifices and hardships of the war. As the conflict dragged on, they resented their increasing burdens from taxes and militia service. They blamed leaders for waging a rich mans war by making it a poor man's fight. The republican promise of equal opportunity invited the dissatisfied to seek more sweeping reforms meant to reduce the power and privileges of genteel leaders./
#+end_quote

- Part of the need for state constitutions is to avoid the political corruption that the Patriots deem to have stemmed from British Empire having an /unwritten/ constitution.

#+begin_quote
  /By modern standards, the new state governments were not all that democratic. Although two-thirds of white men could vote for the assembly, they comprised less than a third of all adults because women, black people, and the poorest whites lacked civil rights. Most states also mandated an even stricter property qualification that precluded 90 percent of men from serving as a state senator or governor./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Unlike democrats, conservatives regarded society as diverse and complex. To suit that vision of society, conservatives desired a more complicated government with a separation of powers, so that two co-equal houses of the legislature, an independent judiciary, and a powerful governor could jealously watch, check, and balance each other. Where democrats concentrated electoral power to fulfill the public will, conservatives sought to limit and complicate the majority’s clout. Distrusting human nature, they regarded inaction (or “gridlock” as we would put it today), as preferable to the hyperactive legislation of popular government./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Charged with being aristocrats, conservatives had to learn how to mask their elitism in the language of republicanism. Posing as the people’s true champions, conservatives encouraged voters to distrust their legislators as corrupt demagogues. In a stroke of political genius, conservatives packaged a separation of powers as the essence of true republicanism./
#+end_quote

- Economic crisis in the 1780s pitted Radicals against Conservatives, especially on issues regarding property and price controls. Public order started to deteriorate as riots became widespread.
- The matter has become severe enough that establishment of a constitutional monarchy was seriously considered. Washington himself at one point thought it might be necessary. Noah Webster, the lexicographer, also penned an essay expressing partiality towards the monarchy option.

#+begin_quote
  /Contrary to modern belief, the founders did not intend to create a national democracy. Instead, they designed a national republic to restrain state democracies, which they blamed for the union’s woes./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By restraining democracy in the states, nationalists hoped to save republican government from a descent into anarchy or a switch to monarchy. They wanted also to preserve the union from splitting into several smaller confederacies, or many individual states, which would contest boundaries and  differences with bloody wars./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Federalists asserted an American people as an act of faith, hoping thereby to generate a self-fulfilling prophecy for the future. An American national identity emerged later, slowly, painfully, and partially. It would follow from that constitution rather than lie behind its creation./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /While claiming to seek the popular will, Federalists tried to limit the ratifying conventions to either approving or rejecting the constitution as a whole, rather than endorse only parts or make ratification contingent upon amendments. By restricting the choice in this way, Federalists maximized their greatest advantage: that they offered an alternative to the ineffectual and unpopular Articles of Confederation. Rather than defend the Articles, most Anti-Federalists proposed sweeping amendments meant to weaken the Federal Constitution./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Many Americans today celebrate the Federal Constitution as perfectly designed to promote democracy, prosperity, and power: as setting the United States on the road to greatness. In 1789, few Americans were so sure, for they worried that sectional and partisan divisions would tear apart a union that seemed too vast and diverse to last./
#+end_quote

- George Washington took his oath as first Preseident of the United States of America on 30 April 1789, in the temporary capital city of New York.
- The new presidency was wrapped in almost monarchical trappings, bolstered by Washington's popularity. He conducted himself, and was presented by the government, in king-like manners. For a moment he was referred to as "His Majesty" and "His Highness".

#+begin_quote
  /During the spring and summer of 1789, Congress created executive departments to assist the president: state, war, treasury, and justice. Washington appointed their heads, with the approval of the Senate, and assembled them as a cabinet to consider major issues. In a pivotal development, Washington secured the power to dismiss executive officials without the Senate’s approval. Thereby the president obtained control over his administration, averting dependence on majority support in the Senate./
#+end_quote

- Alexander Hamilton, as secretary of treasury, proposed major financial reforms, including creation of a central bank, and transfer of state debts to the federal government who will henceforth assume responsibility for them.
- To pass the reforms in Congress, the government agreed on a compromise with Southern lawmakers: the capital will be moved to a spot closer to the south, in Philadelphia.
- The move to Philadelphia is also meant to be temporary; by that point, there were already plans of building a new and grand capital city along Potomac River. The government finally moved in 1800, to the city named after their president.

#+begin_quote
  /During the mid-1790s, Federalist policies produced peace, prosperity, and popularity. In the West, the Federalists secured favorable treaties with Spain, the western Indians, and the British Empire. Recovering impressively from the depression of the 1780s, the nation’s economy boomed after 1792. Hamilton’s financial program stabilized the currency and restored investor confidence. The federal assumption of state debts enabled the states to cut their taxes in half. Neutrality in the European war rewarded American shippers with enhanced trade. Merchants paid higher wages, had more ships built, and erected grander homes./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Federalists and Republicans clashed over the degree of democracy needed to sustain republican government. Federalists insisted that stability required government by an elite secure in the public esteem. Common people should deferentially elect men of superior education, wealth, and status, and those elected officials should enjoy immunity from “licentious” criticism./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Federalists insisted that the revolution was over and had been a limited struggle for independence, but Republicans countered that the revolution remained incomplete and required the democratic transformation of American society. Attacking the genteel vestiges of colonial hierarchy, Republicans promised to create a liberal society in which an impartial government would secure equal opportunities for common men by refusing any superior privileges for elites. Republicans claimed that equal rights would reward the industrious poor rather than perpetuate the idle rich. Without the allegedly artificial distortions of an elitist government, society would naturally and properly promote equality./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /As the French invaded and conquered their Dutch, Swiss, and Italian neighbors, Federalists soured on the new revolution. Already wary of democracy, Federalists came to see in France the anarchic consequences of unchecked popular power. Rejecting the earlier linkage between the two revolutions, Federalists recast the American Revolution as supposedly decorous, orderly, dignified, and solemn—and, therefore, as a complete contrast to the chaotic French version. Federalists began celebrating Britain as the champion of rational liberty, a reassuring bastion of stable government, and the source of profitable commerce./
#+end_quote

- As president, Thomas Jefferson worked to further decentralize the government, and ended the use of quasi-regal trappings for the president.

#+begin_quote
  /Jefferson promoted an “Empire of Liberty,” which favored white men at the expense of Indians and blacks. Rather than restrain westward expansion, as the British Empire and Federalists had tried (and failed) xto do, Jeffersonians helped settlers dispossess Indians. A democratic but racially defined society would expand relentlessly westward, creating thousands of new farms to sustain relative equality among white men. Jeffersonians recognized that the strength of a diffuse nation lay in helping, rather than hindering, ambitious settlers./
#+end_quote

- Despite the Federalist party never having returned to power after 1800, their legacy and philosophy stayed on with Chief Justice John Marshall, who held the position for over three decades.

#+begin_quote
  /Any political victory is temporary. Like a kaleidoscope, we continue in every generation to make new combinations of clashing principles derived from the enduring importance and incompleteness of our revolution. The revolution remains embedded as selective memory in every contemporary debate./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By promising equal rights in an unequal society, the revolution opened social hierarchies to criticism and potential reform./
#+end_quote

- With no titled nobility and aristocracy, the rich property owners and merchants of the United States became the ruling class.
- For the first few decades of the United States' existence, it was much cheaper to pirate British books than pay royalties to American writers and publishers.

#+begin_quote
  /The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution barred the federal government from creating a church establishment, but that ban did not apply to the states—which became political battlegrounds between religious conservatives and their evangelical critics. Conservatives argued that a republic could not survive without the virtuous and moral citizens promoted by state-mandated financial support for religion./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Religious politics made for strange bedfellows as evangelicals allied with secularists to seek disestablishment. Most leading Patriots felt drawn to the anticlerical ideas of the European Enlightenment, but they valued the public morality promoted by churches./

  /The republic’s leaders sought to sustain a broad practice of religion without favoring any one denomination with an establishment. Indeed, they insisted that religion would prosper if all denominations could freely compete for believers./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Patriots drew a sharp line between public manhood and female domesticity. Republicanism emphasized the masculinity of the citizen, imagined as willing and able to bear arms in defense of his liberty and the common good. “Effeminate” was the worst insult that a Patriot could hurl at a rival or enemy. This republican formula treated women’s active participation in the revolution as valuable but ephemeral—and unnatural in peacetime./
#+end_quote

- Many Patriot leaders appealed to equality and liberty, while also brushing aside the issue of slavery. Many who spoke of opposition to slavery were themselves slave owners.
- Free Blacks were treated lowly, and were forced to settle together in poorly developed areas.
- Individualism became the hallmark of American society, and the country's continued economic growth and stability beyon 1790 was celebrated as proof of the power of individual freedom.

#+begin_quote
  /Historians debate how revolutionary the revolution was in its consequences. Some find little substantive change and focus on continuities from the colonial era. Other scholars emphasize expanding economic opportunities and increased political participation by common white men as radical consequences of the revolution. Both views convey only part of the story. The revolution intensified trends already underway, including political assertion by common men, territorial expansion at native expense, and the westward spread of slavery. Acceleration and intensification combined continuity with change./

* AVIGNON AND ITS PAPACY
** /Joelle Rollo - Koster/

- Avignon Papacy has very detailed records of its daily affairs.
- Author believes Clement V has been much maligned, and is a much better pope than usually portrayed.
- Pope John XXII was the first pope to emphasize the connection between heresies and demonic influence.
- Franciscan poverty crisis: should Franciscans allow communal possession of goods, or completely reject it and live in absolute poverty?
- Even before Pope John XXII's rule, the arrangement is that the papacy has nominal possession of the franciscans' properties. The order is largely okay with this, but a faction called the Spirituals insisted on absolute poverty, clashing with the pope and the inquisition on the matter.
- Pope John XXII ruled that obedience to the papacy is paramount, and reiterated that the order is not obligated to live in total poverty, but the goods and properties that they can peruse will be under ownership of the papacy.
- Pope Clement VI has become the symbol of Avignon papacy's worldliness and ostentatiousness. The author does concede that Clement VI never lived a humble life like his predecessors, even quipping that he knew better how to be pope than the ones before him. But of course there's still elements of exaggeration in this.
- The conclave that elected Pope Innocent VI tried to impose greater powers for the College of Cardinals, in expense of the pope's own powers. During his own papacy, Innocent VI repudiated this maneuver, but it will come back again later during the Great Western Schism.
- In the wake of the Hundred Years' War, France was left destitute and overrun by mercenaries. These forces posed significant threat to Avignon papacy, and the Chuch had to forge alliances as well as bribe the mercenaries to keep the city safe.
- Pope Urban V highly supported and encouraged intellectual pursuit for his subjects. He was also fastidious, and personally read and notated thousands of documents.
- Urban V returned to Rome, but to maintain a stable administration, kept the Curia divided between Avignon and Rome.

  /Gregory did not halve the government of the Church as Urban V had done; he left it in place in Avignon, waiting to transfer the curia whole once he was safely settled in Rome. Gregory's decision demonstrates that he understood his place in the symbolic web of the papacy and the expectations attached to his person. Italians wanted to see the father of the Catholic Church, not the French curial bureaucratic machine behind him./

- Gregory XI succeeded in returning the papacy to Rome, but at the cost of inciting violent reaction from his enemies within the city.
- Towards the final days of his life, Gregory XI drafted a new regulation amending conclave rules in dire situations, allowing the voting to start within the 9-day mourning period, and foregoing the two-thirds majority vote. These rules, however, were never enacted.

  /The Avignon papacy transformed the administration of the Church by developing archives and recording procedures. This once more demonstrates the efficiency of its leadership. Registrars copied all letters in ledgers. Those made out of paper remained in Avignon until 1784, when they were shipped to Rome; they are commonly named the Avignon registers. Others were recopied on parchment. They were labeled "Vatican registers" and sent to Rome in the 1430s./

  /One of the lessons the Schism offers institutional historians is that two papal capitals could compete in advancing the legitimacy of their respective claimants and both be successful. Two papal courts could not only survive but flourish. If Rome and Avignon had not been thriving Christian cities, they would not have rivaled each other for papal supremacy for close to two generations without instigating major social upheavals. The Church's administration had been so well defined by the Avignon popes and was so innovative and efficient that it could be cut in half and still function quite effectively./
#+end_quote

- Author seems to take the view that the schism didn't significantly affect religiosity for most Christians. Otherwise, there would've been greater chaos and impetus to resolve the split.
- The book treats both sides of the Schism fairly. Each is not any more right or wrong in claiming Petrine authority, and both struggled to deal with their religious and political circumstances.
- A main reason for the Schism's longevity is the support external parties provided for each side. Especially in the Avignon side, their pope enjoyed financial support from both internal and external sources.
- The author briefly mentions that the Schism promoted the concept of conciliarism, and described it as "dangerous", without elaborating much on it.
- One of the lasting legacies of Avignon papacy is its massive support for education, including benefices for many students.

  /The Avignon popes were certainly no more venal nor less worthy to claim the papal office than their predecessors and successors.

* CATACLYSM
** /David Stevenson/

#+begin_quote
  /The First World War took on characteristics that made it emblematic of other modern wars, extending through the twentieth century and beyond. It visited horrific new experiences on the combatants and forced unprecedented mobilization on their home fronts. As well as being a disaster in its own right it became the precondition for further disasters, including the Second World War, whose casualties numbered millions more. It compelled the creation of new social coping mechanisms in the face of mass death, mutilation, and bereavement, and yet in many regions of the world its legacies fuel bloodshed to this day. Finally, it was a cataclysm of a special kind, a man-made catastrophe produced by political acts, and as such can still a century later both raise powerful emotions and prompt disturbing questions as a portent. Its victims died neither from an unseen virus nor from mechanical failure and individual fallibility. They owed their fate to deliberate state policy, decided on by governments that repeatedly rejected alternatives to violence and commanded not merely acquiescence but also active support from millions of their peoples. Contemporaries on both sides at once hated the slaughter and yet felt unable to disengage from it, embroiled in a tragedy in the classical sense of a conflict between right and right./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The conventions and rituals of warfare were familiar parts of Europe’s life, and the memory of previous conflicts integral to its culture. Until the eighteenth century it had known few years in which none of its great powers were engaged in fighting. Only since then had the modern pattern emerged of  decades of peace punctuated by successively more total wars. Peace – even in the simple sense of the absence of killing – was a modern phenomenon, and Europe had never known anything comparable to the great peace that ended in 1914./

  /Although in summer 1914 international tension was acute, a general war was not inevitable and if one had not broken out then it might not have done so at all. It was the Habsburg monarchy’s response to Sarajevo that caused a crisis./
#+end_quote

- The author thinks that while Austria-Hungary's response to the ultimatum was what caused the war, their grievances towards Serbia were not wholly unjustified, and has some strong reasons to be suspicious of the kingdom.
- On the eve of the War, both Germans and Magyars combined accounted for less than half of Austria-Hungary's population.
- While there was a general sense that Austria-Hungary needs internal reform, prior to the War the empire is fairly stable and united, and that it has certainly weathered more desperate times than 1914.
- Germany may be to blame for starting the war, but it wasn't a premeditated policy either. Germany in 1914 may be ruled by the unstable Wilhelm II, but in general the empire isn't a political outlier or pariah, and isn't aggressively hostile to other European powers.

#+begin_quote
  /In the decade from 1897 to 1908 Wilhelm intervened frequently in policy-making and he always exerted considerable influence over diplomacy and in military and naval matters. Yet this influence was erratic. Wilhelm was intelligent and open-minded but was also a restless and neurotic poseur who spent much of his reign sailing and hunting, and his officials found ways to work round him. All the same, he was Germany’s public face. Although at times of crisis he mostly showed caution, he created the impression that his government was aggressive and militaristic (which normally it was not) and capricious and unpredictable (which it certainly was). His presence for more than a quarter of a century on the throne of such a powerful country grievously undermined European stability./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /By 1914 the crises, the arms race, and Berlin’s encirclement phobia had taken on a mutually reinforcing momentum. Both blocs were consolidating and were more likely to hold firm in the next test: Russia and France had rearmed sufficiently to proceed more boldly while Germany and Austria-Hungary foresaw the balance tipping further against them. The recurrent confrontations impelled statesmen to consider fighting as an alternative to endless scares and threats./
#+end_quote

- Russia did not actively support Serbia in its conflicts in the years prior to 1914, e.g. in the Balkan Wars. However, Russia deemed it necessary to intervene in 1914 because their influence in the Balkans could deteriorate if Austria-Hungary gets their way. Russia also deemed that it's ready for such a war, despite their ongoing rearmament plans not having met its goal yet.
- Instead of waiting for Serbia's response to the ultimatum, Russia immediately went on pre-mobilization process. This arguably forced other country's hands, as Austria-Hungary also immediately mobilized on the day the ultimatum was rejected, on 28 July.

#+begin_quote
  /Across the continent the feeling in the countryside and in small towns – where most units would come from and where most Europeans still lived – was more apprehensive and depressed than in the capital cities. Among intellectuals, although many were exhilarated by manifestations of national unity and welcomed the war as an opportunity for cleansing and regeneration, others viewed it with horror and disgust as a scarcely credible reversion to the primitive. These reactions failed to translate themselves, however, into effective resistance./

  /Whatever the foreboding with which Europeans went to war, little force was needed to make them go. The mass conscription and reservist training systems developed over a generation had taught those mobilized what to do, and the spread of literacy, a national press, and festivals such as Bastille Day in France and Sedan Day in Germany had strengthened the sense of national community./

  /For war to happen governments on both sides had to declare it and to set their military machines in motion. The European peace might have been a house of cards, but someone still had to topple it.

  /In this middle period of the war, between late 1914 and the next major turning point in spring 1917, the powers created a style of combat that in retrospect seemed to encapsulate the conflict as a whole. Its key features were escalation and stalemate, both sides applying rising levels of violence yet failing to terminate the impasse. The war became more nearly total and more global, and from these characteristics much of its enduring impact followed. Yet the  equilibrium was not static but dynamic, the initiative passing back and forth as each side strove to pre-empt or thwart the other’s gambits and attempted new expedients to catch its adversary off balance./

  /The ‘short-war illusion’ that had helped to cause the conflict did not end in 1914. On the contrary, both soldiers and civilians, deprived of the luxury of hindsight, were sustained in part by faith that one more determined heave would bring triumph./
#+end_quote

- Though the battlefield itself was in a state of attrition from end-1914 to early-1918, in reality the war kept escalating to dangerous new levels.
- The parity of strength between the two sides caused the attrition, and also caused them to further escalate, developing new lethal war tools and methods such as tanks and chemical weapons, and opening up new fronts all over the world in hopes of breaking the deadlock.

#+begin_quote
  /In Britain at the time, if not simply called ‘the war’, the conflict was referred to as ‘the great war’, evoking the earlier struggle against Napoleon; in France ‘la guerre’ or ‘la grande guerre’ was the usual description. ‘World war’ and ‘guerre mondiale’ became prevalent only from the 1930s. In Germany, in contrast, ‘Weltkrieg’ was the preferred description from the start, the Berlin leaders understanding that they were fighting for world-power status and that their enemies were concentrating the resources of their empires against them. Americans too referred to the conflict generally as ‘the world war’ (rather than ‘ European war’) after being drawn in, and by 1917 almost all the biggest and strongest countries across the globe had indeed become belligerents./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /As in the July crisis pre-existing alliances influenced decisions for war much less than did considerations of national interest. But unlike in 1914 the later entrants had time to define their requirements and to negotiate with the two sides. Although this more leisured timetable should have permitted ngreater public debate, in fact most of the interventions were driven through by authoritarian governments not only to advance their external interests but also to outmanoeuvre rivals at home./
#+end_quote

- Japan's entry to the war is fueled by both desire to dominate China and to gain international recognition as equals with the Western Powers. They had little to lose for joining, and more to gain especially if their side wins. Finally, Japan is uniquely distant from the main theaters of war, so they are relatively insulated from its worse effects while enjoying the advantage of expanding their sphere of influence with minimal European intervention.
- Armenians were conscripted by both Russian and Ottoman Armies to their side. The Ottoman government did not like that Armenians in Russian territory refused to rebel against Russia. The policy of retribution and eventually genocide spread throughout 1915, and Ottomans justified it as reponse against rebellion and disloyalty.
- Incompatibility and scale of each side's war aims is not enough to explain the failure of diplomacy in ending the War. The war aims of the First World War were much more modest than those of the Second World War.

#+begin_quote
  /If war aims determined what the fighting was for, strategy decided where and when it happened. Yet governments oversaw the commanders’ key decisions, and the basic strategic choices made in the war were as much political as technical. Moreover (and this is often overlooked), the two sides’ strategies interacted, each reflecting an appraisal of the other’s intentions. Both the Allies and the Central Powers committed themselves to mounting levels of violence, culminating in the massive Western and Eastern Front battles of 1916. And when these battles failed to bring decisive results, both approached strategic bankruptcy. Once again the underlying themes here are therefore stalemate and escalation./

#+begin_quote
  /An impasse at the level of tactics drove the two sides towards more ruthless strategies: the Allies towards escalating doses of attrition and the Germans towards Verdun and unrestricted submarine warfare. But this was not a static equilibrium, and both attackers and defenders were increasing their tactical sophistication and the number and power of the weapons at their disposal. Developments were in progress that after 1917 would break the stalemate./
#+end_quote

- Although it can be argued that the Allies would've used lethal gases anyway, it was Germany that initiated its use, and therefore were the unfortunate ones to be leveld with war crime charges for it.
- Aerial warfare was still in its infancy in the First World War, and hardly helped either side. The British enjoyed massive air superiority in Somme, but it proved barely useful for them.
- Aircrafts, however, proved more useful for mapping and surveillance. Aerial mapping was instrumental in producing more accurate battlefield maps, which translated to more accurate artillery firing.

  /Although no continental power had expected so long and punishing an ordeal, their conscription systems meant that they had mostly registered their able-bodied men in peacetime and possessed the machinery to call them up, and also that many men had had military training.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Given the extraordinary casualty rates that the war inflicted from its opening weeks, it may seem strange that the manpower crisis that all the belligerents suffered by 1917 did not set in much earlier. Enough men were found not only to keep the fighting going but also to intensify it in the battles of 1916. One reason, paradoxical as it may seem, was trench warfare./

  /Admittedly, the argument is double-edged: without trenches the two sides could not have remained in such constant close proximity, especially as they were armed, as the war went on, with an increasingly powerful array of weapons. Trenches, and innovations such as railway supply lines and tinned food, enabled the killing to continue throughout the year instead of the armies retiring in the traditional manner to winter quarters./

  /Digging in reduced casualties between battles and slowed down the rate of attrition. Whether it saved lives over the war as a whole is debatable./

  /Post-traumatic stress disorder, to give its modern name to the condition labelled ‘shell shock’ in the English-speaking countries, had doubtless existed in earlier conflicts, but had not been diagnosed as such.

  /In the vast decentralized confusion of a major offensive, in which tens of thousands of men might be engaged along fronts of many miles, the personal control still possible in Napoleon’s day was no longer attainable. Such ‘battles’ had little in common with Waterloo except the term itself./

 /War was expensive. Every one of the millions of bullets and shells fired off had a price tag. Every soldier had to be paid (however miserably), clothed and fed, transported to and from the front and cared for if wounded or ill.

The soldiers’ families were allocated separation allowances, and the disabled, widows, and orphans needed sustenance, as did thousands of refugees./

  /European treasuries were caught between untrammelled military outgoings and the political imperative of not reviving peacetime controversies through tax increases. They tried – and here again the ‘short-war illusion’ was evident – to cover their deficits by borrowing at home and abroad, and beyond that in effect by ‘printing money’ if they received central bank credits without collateral. No central bank preserved much independence in wartime conditions: even the Bank of England, supposedly a private corporation, yielded to the Treasury its influence over interest rates and sterling’s exchange value./

  /The investing public in Germany and Britain wagered on victory in a desperate and evenly matched conflict. To be sure, there were few alternative financial outlets and governments offered attractive incentives, at the cost of mounting debt service and an albatross round the necks of post-war taxpayers.

War finance depended on traditional values and assumptions that  the conflict itself was subverting./

- Beyond 1915, the First World War at sea was also in stalemate, but mainly due to inactivity. Both sides were hesitant to engage the enemy at full power and in the open seas. Much of naval conflict in this period are related to enforcement and breaking of blockades.
- Despite the attrition, the Allies — especially Britain — have clear advantage and dominance in much of the world's seas and oceans.

#+begin_quote
  /The First World War cannot be understood without acknowledging the widespread and continuing acceptance that it was a just, even noble cause. Every belligerent relied on a combination of state compulsion with patriotic support from society, even if the former was relatively more important in the eastern European countries and the latter in the western European ones. Between them these forces not only created an initial political truce in 1914 but also maintained domestic cohesion when the conflict intensified, with a corresponding increase in its demands./

- Officially, the Catholic Church under Pope Benedict XV maintained a neutral stance on the War. Realistically, many Catholics, including clergy, in all belligerent states supported their country's cause.

- The defection of Petrograd garrison in the February Revolution was a response to what the soldiers think was an unreasonable order.

  /The removal of the dynasty, intended to help contain the revolution, probably did more than anything else to convince the peasantry that they could challenge the social order with impunity.

  /While both Bethmann and Wilson might have preferred to keep America neutral, their priorities were fundamentally in conflict. Bethmann intended to confine Washington’s role to bringing the two sides to the conference table, after which America should withdraw while Germany imposed its demands and return only to help set up international institutions that would guarantee the new status quo. Wilson, however, was willing to join a League of Nations only if the peace settlement respected liberal principles. The German leaders were right to suspect he would be biased against them. The escape route of an American-mediated compromise occupied a great deal of attention in Berlin and Washington but was never likely to get anywhere./
#+end_quote

- The primary effect of the Zimmerman incident was in uniting the American public in support of intervention. Wilson himself didn't want it, but ultimately gave in to counsel from his advisers and cabinet, who were unanimously in favor of joining the War.
- Still, Wilson wasn't entirely pressured by the public, and he could've at least opposed intervention and face a divided Congress. And the author thinks such a divided Congress likely wouldn't have approved of intervention had Wilson come out to oppose it too.

#+begin_quote
  /The year 1917 saw the end of the short-war illusion. Even after military deadlock had set in, the hope that one more heave might yet bring victory had lured both sides on. But unrestricted submarine warfare failed to break the British, and the February Revolution wrecked Allied plans for a new round of synchronized offensives. American power would need at least a year to take full effect, and in the meantime Allied co-operation withered. Weapons output peaked, armies diminished, home-front consensus and troop morale faltered, both sides explored less costly strategies, and both moderated their war aims./

- Though the convoy system adopted in 1917 was crucial in reducing shipping losses, it was not the sole factor that helped the Allies. While designed to deter U-boat attacks on merchant ships, the U-boats themselves were dealt with by sea mines, coupled with slower rate of production.
- Petain's solution to the 1917 mutinies was a combination of accomodation to some of the soldiers' grievances, while also punishing some mutiny leaders as form of deterrence. Overall his strategy was successful, and the issue gradually died down within the year.
- I'm only lightly touching this section for the year 1917, because the author also has a book specifically for that year of the War. I've read it before, I'll just reread it some other time.

  /A Russian civil war was always likely after the Bolshevik Revolution, given Lenin’s incomplete control of the country and his contempt for his opponents.

- As the War entered its last year, the conflict increasingly became more ideological.
- Support for Wilson's Fourteen Points meant that the Allies encouraged the many nationalities within Habsburg Empire to push for sovereignty. Though not directly intended, the breakup of the Habsburg monarchy became the final consequence of the Allies' policies.

  /Like the decisions to start the war, those to stop it should be analysed as being in the first instance due to rational appraisal, despite there being evidence that both sides miscalculated./

- When Ludendorff and Hindenburg initiated armistice talks, they wrongly assumed that the cessation of hostilities would give them time to prepare for a future resumption of the conflict. They also thought that Wilson's Fourteen Points are vague enough to be skirted around. Finally, they miscalculated the effect an armistice would have on their remaining allies, especially Austria-Hungary.
- The US wanted to end the War soon as a prolonged conflict could severely damage their economy and the people's morale. Britain and France wanted also an earlier end of hostilities, but mainly because a prolonged War would allow the US to further dominate the Entente alliance, to the European Powers' detriment.

  /The Dual Monarchy was destroyed, as its leaders had long dreaded, by a combination of nationalist uprisings with pressure from outside.

#+begin_quote
  /Whereas the Austro-Hungarian revolutions had been led by pre-formed national committees, the German uprising surprised even the left-wing parties, resembling Russia’s February Revolution rather than that of October.

  /The First World War was the greatest event of its time, not only for what happened during it but also for its subsequent impact. Its global repercussions extended down to 1945, and arguably to the collapse of Soviet Communism and the end of the Cold War, not to say beyond. It has become customary to see it as the opening of an age of catastrophe, or as the beginning of a ‘short twentieth century’ that lasted until 1989, after which (and especially after 11 September 2001) the world entered a different era./

  /As the years have passed – and particularly since a second and even greater world war – that of 1914–18 has become a less dominating imaginative and political landmark.

- The terms of the Treaty of Versailles were written to be simply drafts meant for later renegotiations. Instead, the parties opted to adopt them as the definitive conditions.

#+begin_quote
  /It became clear almost at once that the Germans would not voluntarily comply with the settlement, and that the Allies faced the prospect of continuing vigilance and confrontation at a time when most of their demobilized soldiers desperately wanted to return to normality and to their private lives. All the same, during the 1920s, although the post-war world was a turbulent place, at least there was little risk of another major armed conflict. By the 1930s even this was no longer true, and hopes that the sacrifices of 1914–18 could ‘end war’ – that they could eliminate the international insecurity that had caused the calamity – were cruelly disappointed. It was probably for this reason more than any other that many not only in the defeated countries but even in the victorious ones came to see the entire enterprise as having been futile, and this perception both modified the way in which the war was remembered and influenced Western politicians in favour of appeasement./
#+end_quote

- Author argues that the main reason the postwar settlement collapsed is because of disunity.
- Japan wanted to be recognized as equals with the Western Powers in the Treaty, even if just by general principle. The recommendation was actually approved by majority, but Wilson ultimately ruled that it cannot be accepted.
- The more central concern for Japan was the issue of Shandong in China. The Japanese wanted to keep it, and convinced the Allies that they will negotiate its return to China in the future. Wilson dissented, but wanting to keep Tokyo in the conference, he ultimately acquiesced.

  /The Germans struck a chord with many in Britain and America when they charged that the Versailles treaty was a hypocritical Diktat: a dictated peace, imposed by threat of force, violating the armistice agreement, and applying Wilson’s principles one-sidedly. Germany was disarmed, but the Allies were not (although they promised to consider disarmament). Germany lost its colonies, but the Allies kept theirs, and added former German and Ottoman possessions. Self-determination was applied where it would damage Germany, but ignored where it might not. Versailles considerably exceeded a strict reading of the Fourteen Points (for example in the Saar and Rhineland and over war pensions), and the Allies gave Germany little if any credit for the removal of Wilhelm II’s autocracy./

  /The treaty could have stopped another bloodbath if it had been upheld. More difficult is the question of whether it sealed the fate of German democracy and ensured the return of a militarist regime. On the one hand, the democratization of the country was incomplete even before the treaty was signed and the elites inherited from before the German revolution had not abandoned their struggle against the Allies. On the other, however, although the treaty certainly inflamed German nationalism, it contained deliberately inserted provisions to allow for relaxation and reconciliation if Germany’s behaviour changed./

- Germany's inability to pay war reparations after 1921 led to France occupying the Ruhr mines in 1923. This in turn caused greater financial strain for the Weimar Republic, which ran into hyperinflation.
- In the US, hundreds of thousands of Black population resettled from the south to the north. Race-related violence spread throughout the country, with the KKK being re-restablished on a national scale. Wilson did not do enough to help out the Blacks.

  /The establishment of a pervasive cult of war commemoration had the potential to act as a conservative, patriotic, integrative force, and governments deliberately encouraged it with this intention. The phenomenon of ‘remembrance’ was one of the most striking novelties of the decade, and it carried a special emotional charge because of the conflict’s human balance sheet./

- The large amount of casualties left by the War necessitated a new form of welfare, one aimed at caring for the War veterans.
- Radical left-wing movements arose immediately following the War, but beaten back by right-wing counteroffensives by early 1920s. In general, moderates partial to the status quo dominated the 1920s. However, right-wing politics also gradually became more intensified.
- European economic growth was much slower in the interwar period than either before WW1 or after WW2. Part of this is because of surplus productions and financial volatility.
- Despite the signs of economic recovery in the late 1920s, in general the economic issues caused by the war weren't resolved and merely alleviated.
- When the Great Depression arrived in Europe, it hit the continent very hard. This was further compounded by the countries' refusal to cooperate with each other due to lingering postwar animosity.

- Pacifism became more widepread in Britain and its territories, fueled by disillusionment from the War. Economic hardships also contributed to unwillingness to assert the terms of Versailles, and made appeasement an attractive policy until 1938.
- The US also became more isolationist in the interwar period.
- The retreat of Britain and the United States also affected France's disposition, which tried to forestall conflict by being lenient on the enforcement of Versailles treaty. All these combined precisely at the time when Hitler was rising, thus they were unable to stop him before Hitler achieved full control of Germany.
- The prevalence of the "stab in the back" mindset also deterred opposition against Hitler, further strengthening his base.
- After the Second World War, its memory and lessons supplanted those of the First. The 1914-1918 conflict became less significant, and when drawing lessons to past conflicts, future leaders and policymakers went as far back as the interwar period but rarely delved in the First World War.

#+begin_quote
  /Even though his first book has better withstood criticism, it overstated the unanimity within the Berlin elite and understated the resemblances between Germany’s war aims and those of the Allies. None the less, most German historians came round to its more nuanced assessment of Germany’s role in the July crisis, and (despite some important qualifications by subsequent writers) much of its analysis of the scope of German wartime ambitions has survived unchallenged./

  /Whereas most previous studies of the origins of the war had concentrated on the diplomatic interplay between all the powers, Fischer exploited the new archival sources to highlight the connections between foreign and domestic policy in one country. He inspired a succession of comparable studies of pre-1914 foreign policy and of war aims in the other powers. Hence during the 1970s and 1980s the diplomatic history of the war’s origins, course, and aftermath was substantially rewritten, while the intensification of the superpower arms race in the era of Euromissiles and the Strategic Defense Initiative stimulated interest among political scientists in 1914 analogies. The new research uncovered more  of pre-war contingency planning for a European conflict, but little for any premeditated decision to launch one, and it suggested that war aims in the Allied countries were more tentative, defensive, and detached from domestic conflicts than they were in  None the less, all the belligerent governments paid close attention to their political objectives, and examination of the other powers reinforced Fischer’s essential insight that the killing was begun and prolonged through deliberate political will./

#+begin_quote
  /To an extent, as the inter-war revisionists argued, the war was indeed the child of fear and insecurity, born of an international system based on armed and sovereign states, in which the developing nineteenth-century forces of democratization and economic integration failed to eclipse the balance of power system. All the European powers contributed to the growth of tension in the pre-1914 decade. None the less, the fundamental contention of the Versailles ‘war-guilt’ article was justified, and the work of writers such as Albertini and Fischer has confirmed it. The rulers of Austria–Hungary and Germany did not predetermine before 1914 their decision to resort to force, but in the July–August crisis they made a decision to start a Balkan war and to accept the risk that it would escalate into a European one. Certainly both governments felt threatened, but for neither was this much of a mitigating circumstance./

#+begin_quote
  /It might seem easiest to adopt the absolute pacifist position – that in no circumstances can force ever be justified – were it not for the evidence that inaction may lead to even greater evils. Yet any decision for war must confront the historical evidence that it is a fearfully blunt instrument, the repercussions of whose use cannot reliably be predicted and which may make matters even worse. Intrinsic to all military undertakings, however legitimate their motives, is the risk that they will violate the principle of proportionality between ends and means, and that they too will lead to a bad war and a bad peace. The 1914–18 conflict and the settlement that followed it remain archetypes of both, and the insights to be gained from studying them have a universal applicability, if only as a distant but a forceful warning./

* IMAGINED COMMUNITIES
** /Benedict Anderson/

#+begin_quote
  /Nationality, or, as one might prefer to put it in view of that word’s multiple significations, nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artefacts of a particular
kind. To understand them properly we need to consider carefully how they have come into historical being, in what ways their meanings have changed over time, and why, today, they command such profound emotional legitimacy. I will be trying to argue that the creation of these artefacts towards the end of the eighteenth century was the spontaneous distillation of a complex ‘crossing’ of discrete historical forces; but that, once created, they became ‘modular,’ capable of being transplanted, with varying degrees of self-consciousness, to a great variety of social terrains, to merge and be merged with a correspondingly wide variety of political and ideological constellations. I will also attempt to show why these particular cultural artefacts have aroused such deep attachments./

  /If the manner of a man’s dying usually seems arbitrary, his mortality is inescapable. Human lives are full of such combinations of necessity and chance. We are all aware of the contingency and ineluctability of our particular genetic heritage, our gender, our life-era, our physical capabilities, our mother-tongue, and so forth. The great merit of traditional religious world-views (which naturally must be distinguished from their role in the legitimation of specific systems of domination and exploitation) has been their concern with man-in-the-cosmos, man as species being, and the contingency of life. The extraordinary survival over thousands of years of Buddhism, Christianity or Islam in dozens of different social formations attests to their imaginative response to the overwhelming burden of human suffering – disease, mutilation, grief, age, and death./

  /The great weakness of all evolutionary/progressive styles of thought, not excluding Marxism, is that such questions are answered with impatient silence. At the same time, in different ways, religious thought also responds to obscure intimations of immortality, generally by transforming fatality into continuity (karma, original sin, etc.). In this way, it concerns itself with the links between the dead and the yet unborn, the mystery of regeneration./

  /Kingship organizes everything around a high centre. Its legitimacy derives from divinity, not from populations, who, after all, are subjects, not citizens. In the modern conception, state sovereignty is fully, flatly, and evenly operative over each square centimetre of a legally demarcated territory. But in the older imagining, where states were defined by centres, borders were porous and indistinct, and sovereignties faded imperceptibly into one another. Hence, paradoxically enough, the ease with which pre-modern empires and kingdoms were able to sustain their rule over immensely heterogeneous, and often not even contiguous, populations for long periods of time./

- Halfway through chapter 2, the author is now analyzing Rizal's and Balagtas' works haha.
- One early example of how capitalism spreads is with print publishing. Once the market for Latin-reading elite has been saturated, publishers moved on to vernacular audiences. The spread of ideas from printed publications was, in a way, a product of capitalistic pursuits.
  
#+begin_quote
  /The coalition between Protestantism and print-capitalism, exploiting cheap popular editions, quickly created large new reading publics – not least among merchants and women, who typically knew little or no Latin – and simultaneously mobilized them for politico-religious purposes.

The same earthquake produced Europe’s first important non-dynastic, non-city states in the Dutch Republic and the Commonwealth of the Puritans./

  /The universality of Latin in mediaeval Western Europe never corresponded to a universal political system. The contrast with Imperial China, where the reach of the mandarinal bureaucracy and of painted characters largely coincided, is instructive.

  /It is likely that the esotericization of Latin, the Reformation, and the haphazard development of administrative vernaculars are significant, in the present context, primarily in a negative sense – in their contributions to the dethronement of Latin. It is quite possible to conceive of the emergence of the new imagined national communities without any one, perhaps all, of them being present. What, in a positive sense, made the new communities imaginable was a half-fortuitous, but explosive, interaction between a system of production and productive relations (capitalism), a technology of communications (print), and the fatality of human linguistic diversity./

  /In a pre-print age, the reality of the imagined religious community depended profoundly on countless, ceaseless travels.

These great Latin-speaking institutions drew together what today we would perhaps regard as Irishmen, Danes, Portuguese, Germans, and so forth, in communities whose sacred meaning was every day deciphered from their members’ otherwise inexplicable juxtaposition in the refectory./

- The author is hammering the connection of highly literate sectors of society with 'print capitalism', which together helped spread the use of vernaculars, which in turn facilitated the conceptualization of a unified identity among speakers of similar languages. Hence, nationalism.

#+begin_quote
  /An illiterate bourgeoisie is scarcely imaginable. Thus in world-historical terms bourgeoisies were the first classes to achieve solidarities on an essentially imagined basis. But in a nineteenth-century Europe in which Latin had been defeated by vernacular print-capitalism for something like two centuries, these solidarities had an outermost stretch limited by vernacular legibilities. To put it another way, one can sleep with anyone, but one can only read some people’s words./

  /The general growth in literacy, commerce, industry, communications and state machineries that marked the nineteenth century created powerful new impulses for vernacular linguistic unification within each dynastic realm. Latin hung on as a language-of-state in Austro-Hungary as late as the early 1840s, but it disappeared almost immediately thereafter. Language-of-state it might be, but it could not, in the nineteenth century, be the language of business, of the sciences, of the press, or of literature, especially in a world in which these languages continuously interpenetrated one another./

Traitor to whom or to what?). In the wake of the disaster that overtook Germany in 1918, he was taken at his implied word. Acting in the name of the German nation, civilian politicians (publicly) and the General Staff (with its usual courage, secretly) sent him packing from the Fatherland to an obscure Dutch suburb./

From this time on, the legitimate international norm was the nation-state, so that in the League even the surviving imperial powers came dressed in national costume rather than imperial uniform. After the cataclysm of World War II the nation-state tide reached full flood. By the mid-1970s even the Portuguese Empire had become a thing of the past./

- The colonials who were educated in Europe and recruited back into the colonial governments became the last wave of linguistic nationalists. Their intermingling with the metropolitans in Europe fueled the idea that nationalism ought not be defined merely by common language.

#+begin_quote
  /The intelligentsias were central to the rise of nationalism in the colonial territories, not least because colonialism ensured that native agrarian magnates, big merchants, industrial entrepreneurs, and even a large professional class were relative rarities. Almost everywhere economic power was either monopolized by the colonialists themselves, or unevenly shared with a politically impotent class of pariah (non-native) businessmen – Lebanese, Indian and Arab in colonial Africa, Chinese, Indian, and Arab in colonial Asia. It is no less generally recognized that the intelligentsias’ vanguard role derived from their bilingual literacy, or rather literacy and bilingualism. Print-literacy already made possible the imagined community floating in homogeneous, empty time of which we have spoken earlier. Bilingualism meant access, through the European language-of-state, to modern Western culture in the broadest sense, and, in particular, to the models of nationalism, nationness, and nation-state produced elsewhere in the course of the nineteenth century./

  /In an age when it is so common for progressive, cosmopolitan intellectuals (particularly in Europe?) to insist on the near-pathological character of nationalism, its roots in fear and hatred of the Other, and its affinities with racism, it is useful to remind ourselves that nations inspire love, and often profoundly self-sacrificing love. The cultural products of nationalism – poetry, prose fiction, music, plastic arts – show this love very clearly in thousands of different forms and styles. On the other hand, how truly rare it is to find analogous nationalist products expressing fear and loathing. Even in the case of colonized peoples, who have every reason to feel hatred for their imperialist rulers, it is astonishing how insignificant the element of hatred is in these expressions of national feeling./

  /While it is true that in the past two decades the idea of the family-as-articulated-power-structure has been much written about, such a conception is certainly foreign to the overwhelming bulk of mankind. Rather, the family has traditionally been conceived as the domain of disinterested love and solidarity. So too, if historians, diplomats, politicians, and social scientists are quite at ease with the idea of ‘national interest,’ for most ordinary people of whatever class the whole point of the nation is that it is interestless. Just for that reason, it can ask for sacrifices./

  /There is a special kind of contemporaneous community which language alone suggests – above all in the form of poetry and songs. Take national anthems, for example, sung on national holidays. No matter how banal the words and mediocre the tunes, there is in this singing an experience of simultaneity. At precisely such moments, people wholly unknown to each other utter the same verses to the same melody./
#+end_quote

- It is precisely in the idea of nationalism being "imagined" that it is an expression of unity and selfless love. Nation invites belongingness and inclusivity. In contrast, racism seeks to exclude and discriminate, to highlight the unchosen qualities, especially race and color, and use it to impose fear and division.
- Author also highlights Makario Sakay's Constitution for the Tagalog Republic, to emphasize that reverse racism is hardly ever a thing, and that the sense of nationalism among colonials actually harbored a sense of equality among all races.



* LOST IN MATH
** /Sabine Hossenfelder/

- Author argues that scientists - physicists specifically - should not let the concepts of beauty and aesthetics to dictate their theories.
- It's impossible to test all hypotheses, and some criteria have to be used to determine viability of each. Author contends that aesthetics as such a criteria isn't the way to go.
- Math is most useful as representation of reality. Math is used to formulate theories, and when tested and proved true, it suffices even if the result isn't directly observable.
- The problem with Schrodinger's cat is that the question looks at the state of the cat upon opening the box. The actual mystery that should be solved is what the cat's state /before/ opening the box. This illustrates the underlying problem of quantum mechanics.

  /Black holes form when a sufficiently large amount of matter collapses under the gravitational pull of its own mass. If the matter fails to build up sufficient internal pressure—for example, because a star has exhausted all its fuel—then it can continue to collapse until concentrated in a single point. Once the matter is concentrated enough, the gravitational pull at its surface becomes so strong that not even light can escape: a black hole has been created. The boundary of the trapping region is called the “event horizon.” Light launched directly at the horizon will just about fail to escape, going around in a circle forever, and since nothing travels faster than light, nothing can escape from inside the black hole./

* MAGISTERIA
** /Nicholas Spencer/

- The book's title comes from Stephen Jay Gould's description of science and religion as being "non-overlapping magisteria".
- The main narrative of war between science and religion began in the wake of Darwin's work on theory of evolution. Medieval examples, like with Galileo and Copernicus, were revived in the 19th century in the course of evolution debates.
- It was a biographer of Columbus, Washington Irving, that popularized the false notion that flat earth belief was widespread prior to the discovery of the New World.
- Copernicus has formed his heliocentric model decades before publishing it. For various reasons, he dragged his foot on the publication. The author implicitly argues that Copernicus would've been more well-received if he published earlier, during more accomodating conditions under friendlier church leaders. This argument does have some hindsight bias.
- Copernicus' protege, Rheticus, consulted a protestant friend named Andreus Osiander to review the work. Osiander offered to write a preface, in which he downplayed the impact of the work, insisting that readers treat it more as thought experiment rather than actual truth. Rheticus declined, but the preface somehow got into the final version anyway. Osiander's preface has both undermined the book's scientific value, while also further degrading copernicus' reputation with the church authorities, all within the unfolding drama of Reformation and Counter-Reformation.
- Galileo's trial was an issue of the Church imposing both theological and philosophical authority over the field of sciences. It was less about what his work actually says, but about who decides its merits. It does make me feel bad for Galileo, as he seem to have been a good Catholic until the end.



* MEDIEVAL CHRISTIANITY
** /Kevin Madigan/

- Two crucial differences between Gnosticism and (early) Christianity:
  - Gnosticism's end goal is freedom from ignorance; For Christianity, it's freedom from sin.
  - In Gnosticism, such salvation from ignorance is attainable only by a few. In Christianity, the promise of salvation is extended to everyone, and ideally everyone will be capable of attaining it too.
- Boethius deliberately did not quote the Scriptures in his work consolation of Philosophy, as he meant it as a meditation on topics like the problem of evil, and free will, in a more philosophical manner.
- Celtic Christianity was a specific kind of Christianity practiced in the Britain and Ireland. It placed greater emphasis on monasticism than the rest of Europe. Even in hierarchy, monasteries and abbots became substitute to dioceses and bishops, respectively. It is not, however, heretical or schismatic. Celts were never on a brink of breaking with Rome.

  /No saint’s life from the early Middle Ages is very trustworthy, historically speaking, because medieval hagiographers were not interested in producing biographies but in writing edifying literature for those aspiring to sanctity.

  /No other service was so treasured as the monks’ capacity to pray for society. Monks were imagined by those who founded and supported them as a sort of spiritual militia; they fought against the society’s spiritual enemies, especially the archenemy Satan and his minions. Above all, donors of land and buildings expected that monks would satisfy for the sins they committed against God by their prayers. Punishing penances could be satisfied not by the sinner but by his surrogate, the monk; he performed by his liturgical prayers the penances accumulated by lay sinners./

- The focus on monastic prayers to aid in salvation later resulted in most monks being ordained into the priesthood. This allowed them to perform the highest prayer that could be made - the Mass.

#+begin_quote
  /The essential work of the monks, from the point of view of the society that supported them, was intercessory prayer. A donor who endowed a monastery could be assured that no matter the enormity of his transgressions, regardless of the weight of sin he had accumulated, his penance would be “prayed down” by a community he founded, a community all then believed would exist in perpetuity. An institution that in Benedict’s time was isolated and profoundly disinclined to offer service to surrounding communities, one that concentrated on the supernatural aspirations of its monks, came to offer both civic and spiritual benefits without which early-medieval society found it could not live./

- Possibly an important factor for the growth of the Pope's temporal power is Rome's distance from the "Roman" Empire in Constantinople. The emperor's primary representative in the West is the exarch of Ravenna, who is also physically distant from Rome and had little to offer on the city's many issues. Hence, the people relied on their wealthiest and most prominent resident: the Bishop of Rome.
- A major innovation of Gregory the Great is the deployment of monks for missionary work. This became the precedent for religious orders in centuries to come, and reinforced Rome's power and authority over Christians in faraway territories.
- Author briefly touched on the controversial Donation of Constantine. The document was a forgery from the 8th century, and has been argued to have been used to support papal supremacy. However, the document wasn't used for such purposes in the succeeding centuries, and by the early 11th century has already been proven to be fake.
- In Germanic lands, the most common type of church is a proprietary church. It's a small church built by the local lord, who also appoints the local clergy and simply gives visiting privileges to the bishop.
- Though clerical celibacy has been the tradition for centuries, the appointed priests for proprietary churches can be married men, even ones with concubines. The parishioners themselves were mostly indifferent about this, only grateful to have a local clergy to depend on.

#+begin_quote
  /Although a few bishops and some synods in the early Middle Ages insisted on clerical continence, their words were a dead letter. Simply put, virtually no rural parishioner or priest in the year 1000 regarded clerical concubinage or marriage as practically or canonically objectionable; it would be more than a century before this would change and we begin to have evidence of reforming lay groups demanding clerical celibacy. Given the difficulties of rural life, the economic motivations for having a wife, and the peasant origins of the clerical clergy, it was doubtless the case that celibacy was thought by many to be too lofty an ideal; some were probably even unaware that clerical concubinage or marriage was uncanonical. Additionally, the indifference or ignorance of parishioners and priests was reinforced by a regime of imperfect episcopal supervision, not to mention that the practices around clerical education and formation were barely adequate, and to describe them as such is being charitable./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Part of medieval culture was a dynamic interaction between elements of the Christian faith sponsored by priests and those given life or popularity by the people. In attempting to understand medieval Christianity, we stray far from the truth if we imagine priests and people as inhabiting two different worlds of thought and practice or if we believe that the experience of ordinary medieval folk can be captured in the vocabulary of folklore and with the social scientific tools used to describe it today./

- Though Jews were indeed, at times, persecuted in Medieval Europe, by and large they didn't lived in desolation all those times. Many anti-Jewish policies and laws were "implemented", but in the sense that they were put into legal writing, but were ignored in practice anyway.
- In the early Middle Ages, the Church has sought help from secular rulers for protection. This culminated in a papal anointed monarch, like Charlemagne, and later on the Holy Roman Emperors. But this dependence also meant that the secular rulers felt more entitled to ecclesiastical authority, even dressing themselves up like the bishops of the church. This arrangement, necessary at first but centuries later became less so, would be a factor in the ensuing Investiture Crisis.

#+begin_quote
  /The model of the ancient church and the “life of the apostles” (vita apostolica) were increasingly not just influential or suggestive. More and more, they were understood to be normative. As such, they superseded any practice that was regarded as merely customary or temporarily useful; evolution from ancient conventions slowly became seen as evidence of degeneration from treasured, pristine ideals, archetypes that the church ought, in the eyes of reformers, to embrace again. Reform was largely imagined, then, in terms of a restoration of usages that were imagined to have prevailed as disciplinary, ecclesiastical, moral, and legal norms in the apostolic age./

  /The differences between monastic and scholastic education can be, and have been, exaggerated. We need to remember that even those schools in cities were for clerics training for ordination. Almost needless to say, all “believed in” and serviced the Deity. No scholastic ever claimed to have invented a portion of revelation. Rather, he worked within the very framework of the deposit of faith and attempted, by the strict application of reason, to understand it more profoundly. In other words, in ways that may seem backward to some today, he sought to understand what he already knew to be so. Belief preceded understanding; the latter clarified and reinforced the former./

  /The domination of both spiritual and temporal realms was to prove costly, in every way, to the papacy. Secular authorities never accepted the papacy’s claims to temporal oversight. In the ecclesiastical realm, as popes increased their power, they also caused suspicion and frustration among the faithful. As popes claimed more and more authority and acquired more power over Christendom and as the curia became a sort of Supreme Court of Christendom, the successors of St. Peter, ever in need of more money, resorted to a tactic hated in the Middle Ages more than today: taxation. In many other ways, the papacy was believed to have departed from apostolic practice. These deviations from normative practice and the fathomless need for revenue slowly robbed the papacy of affection and respect, with profound consequences in the centuries to come./

  /The papacy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries began increasing taxes and fees for existing services and charging more and new taxes. Traditional papal revenues included income gained from papal landed estates and a number of other, relatively minor, sources, including Peter’s Pence, a small annual tax; tributes from monasteries under the protection of St. Peter; and so forth. The point of no return came when the papacy began to tax the income of the clergy. Initially, it did so to pay for the Crusades. Later, these funds were used indiscriminately, and the rates at which the clergy could be taxed were equally promiscuous. Finally, the tax went from being an occasional impost to becoming a general tax, from which the papacy derived a dependable stream of revenue by the mid-thirteenth century. There is some grim irony in contemplating that when it came to taxing its main constituency, the papal government was far ahead of its secular counterparts./
#+end_quote

- The roots of medieval conciliarism were planted throughout centuries, as papal power gradually increased and intensified. By the 13th and 14th centuries, power in the Church has been massively centralized to the pope and his curia. All sorts of taxation and petty penny-pinching have been implemented. The vicar of Christ has become more powerful and much wealthier than secular kings and emperors. All this will culminate in the rise of ecumenical councils targeted towards reforming the moribund papacy.

  /The language of worship, Latin, was not understood, at least not outside the Italian peninsula. This made weekly worship relatively ineffective as a medium of teaching and learning the faith. More insight into the faith they professed may well have been achieved by parishioners in extraordinary times, such as the feast of Good Friday, when the cross was adored, or on Easter, when a new fire was started—and in some parts of Europe, this fire would have been taken into homes. A very powerful impact indeed could have been achieved by these acts of nonverbal ritual and ceremony. Yet it remains true that clergy did not succeed in using worship as a mode of instruction, primarily because they did not even attempt to use it in that way./
#+end_quote

- It can be difficult to discern the purpose of imageries and icons in medieval churches because of much variety. But the author thinks it's unlikely they were effective as religious instruction. Many, like stained glasses, can look very abstract, and some are even placed too high to be comfortably viewed.

  /By 1300, the church’s lawyers had designated very precisely the conditions—thirteen in all—in which one could charge interest for loans. The new theology of confession and purgatory also helped ease the way for the church grudgingly to tolerate the practice of trade. Treatment of the sin of usury was relocated from the court to the confessional and thus to the conscience of the tradesman. This helped ease the way for the recognition that there was nothing intrinsically sinful in routine commercial transactions./

  /Indeed, the expression of this highly theoretical view of Roman authority coincided with the loss of actual power in the provincial churches, as kings and secular lords asserted their jurisdiction within their realms and created national churches from the ruins of a Christendom that had crumbled. In this, they reversed trends initiated and supported by the papacy since the eleventh century, when the popes had struggled to free the local churches from secular control. The royal powers were helped enormously by the schism, which accelerated the process of the disintegration of Christendom into territorial and national churches. With these powerful and irreversible trends, the theoretical claims of/ Laetentur Coeli /were in preposterous conflict. What seemed to matter to the popes was that claims be made as magnificent as possible, however impossible their chances of achieving actual expression./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /As these grand claims were made, popes in the century between ca. 1430 and 1530 concentrated their efforts on protecting their Italian domain and in lavishly reconstructing the city of Rome. It is not for nothing that these pontiffs are often called “Renaissance popes.” Posterity owes to them at least the glory of the Sistine Chapel and, more ambiguously, the construction of the new St. Peter’s Basilica. But it seems these popes were constantly enmeshed in war; Italian politics; conflict with the city-states; trafficking in ecclesiastical offices; elevating their relatives (including their children, of whom one pope sired sixteen) to high office; and in the generation and accumulation of art and treasure./

  /No matter how much one confessed, it was impossible to say if one was in a state of grace and justified in the eyes of God. Far from offering relief, the salvific instrumentalities of the late-medieval church could have encouraged hypersensitivity and doubt. In the end, what one group of Christians could feel as consolation, another could feel as anxiety-causing torment and, finally, un-Christian. When Christians split over this issue—on how they might be saved—when the same set of Christian practices and pastoral pieties could generate diametrically opposite emotional and religious responses; when one Christian, emerging from the confessional, could feel serene relief and another near-immediate doubt, the Christian Middle Ages can be said to have come to an end. It was profound disagreement over the issue of the media and mechanism of salvation, then, that did much to sunder the religious unity of the medieval Western church./

* MEDIEVAL EUROPE
** /Chris Wickham/

#+begin_quote
  /Many writers about the middle ages have been preoccupied with the origins of those ‘nation’-states, or with other aspects of what they see as ‘modernity’, and for them it is these outcomes which give meaning to the period. This for me is seriously mistaken. History is not teleological: that is to say, historical development does not go to; it goes from. Furthermore, as far as I am concerned, the medieval period, full of energy as it was, is interesting in and for itself; it does not need to be validated by any subsequent developments./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The Christian laity, whether or not they were well informed about the details of doctrine, and whether or not they were prepared actually to follow clerical exhortations, particularly over such deeply held attitudes as those concerning honourable violence or sex, did indeed accept that religion was important, and indeed all-pervasive./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The self-servingness of much medieval religious rhetoric, particularly when it was the work of the powerful, can often be only too obvious to us; but it was not hypocritical. It might, sometimes, be more palatable (to us) if it had been; but such people, in almost every case, really did believe what they were saying. We have to factor that real belief into every assessment of medieval political action, however carefully and cunningly targeted./
#+end_quote

  /When we are faced with really big events – the end of European peace in 1914, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 – historians tend to divide between those who see the catastrophe as inevitable, with structural causes, often long-term ones, which just happen to come together in a sudden shift, and those who see it as chance, the product of short-term, almost casual, political decisions; or else, when they are more nuanced, between those who, in the mélange of structural and political causes, put more weight on the former or else the latter./
#+end_quote

- Author argues that structural factors cannot have caused the "fall" of the Roman Empire, as half of the Empire survived.

#+begin_quote
  /What happened in the fifth century in the western Roman empire, put succinctly, is that ‘barbarian’ incursions from the north, although they had been a feature of most of imperial history, this time led to political breakdown: armies which did not call themselves Roman took over the different western provinces and carved out kingdoms for themselves./
#+end_quote

- Author argues that the fall of Carthage in 439 was the beginning of the "fall" of the Roman Empire. Without Africa, Rome lost revenue, then lost troops, then became dependent on "barbarian" armies, who finally took control for themselves.
- As individual Germanic tribes carved out their own provincial kingdoms for themselves, the centralized taxation system that leads back to Rome broke down. From here on, the main source of wealth for the many new kingdoms will be landowning.
- This point now ties in with another book by this author, *Framing the Early Middle Ages*.

#+begin_quote
  /The culture of the public, assembly politics, Christianity and the network of bishops, a disappearing tax system and the beginning of the politics of land, a less wealthy aristocracy and a more independent peasantry, a simpler economic system: all these features marked out the post-Roman kingdoms. So did a landed army run by no-longer-civilian aristocrats, which meant that aristocratic values became highly militarised from them on, and remained so for the rest of the middle ages and beyond./

  /From as early as the 640s, the caliphs seem to have decided that the Arab armies would not settle on the land, as Germanic groups had done earlier, but instead were to be settled in cities and paid directly from taxation – the taxation, that is to say, which already existed in both the Roman empire and Persia, and which would still be for a long time collected and administered by traditional Roman and Persian élites. The practice of supporting the army, the ruling class and the state by a sophisticated system of taxation never failed in the Arab world./

  /As with the end of the western Roman empire, the Arab conquests have been viewed by much western scholarship through a veil of moralisation, about the failure of civilisation and the imperial project, and the triumph of barbarism./

  /They have also been seen though the lens of Orientalism: this was the moment when the eastern and southern Mediterranean ceased to be part of a common civilisation with the northern coasts, and became an Other, full of incomprehensible intrigue and harsh and repetitive – indeed, essentially meaningless – changes of régime, under a harsh sun./

  /It was also only too easy for Christian polities to see Muslim ones as existential threats, and sometimes they acted on that imagery, as, most dramatically, at the time of the crusades; and it was certainly much harder for the Christian polities to learn from the Muslim ones, even when there was much to learn. We have to recognise this difference, while not being taken in by it./

- Author notes that the period when iconoclasm became a major religious crisis in the Byzantine Empire, was also roughly the time when caliphates banned human imagery in religious representations. However the author was also quick to note that this does not necessarily mean causation.
- The political structure of the Carolingian Empire, starting with Charlemagne, is considered an innovation over the traditional Roman structure. Local units were still ruled by various local aristocrats, but their roles are more well-defined, and even bishops were granted judicial roles. Charlemagne also sent out bureaucrats to occasionally check on these local rulers and stamp out irregularities.

  /Everything in Carolingian high politics was by now so tied up with the validation of divine approval that resolutions of political problems by means of penitential and other ecclesiastical ritual were seen by every player as entirely appropriate procedures. This religious understanding was not exactly practical (indeed, the panic of 828–29 could easily be seen as a huge waste of everyone’s time), but that was not the point. Even in crisis, the Carolingian political world was ambitious beyond ordinary levels, for they assumed that everything they did, including when they did it badly, was crucial to God./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Christianity did not do that by itself, of course. When different polities in the north went Christian, mostly what this meant was the conversion of kings and their entourages – the rest of the population followed after, often long after – and that conversion, however genuine, usually only slowly affected the range of values and practices which each society regarded as normal, meritorious and moral, for these values were now defined as Christian as well, whether or not they resembled those of the New Testament./

- The arrival of Christianity in Ireland didn't fully displace the old political and religious system. Instead it was appropriated, and the druids of old became the priests of the new.
- The fragmented nature of Irish Christianity owes more to the old system adapting to the new one, and coincided with the "fall" of the western Roman Empire.

#+begin_quote
  /Up to the eleventh century, kings – and also regional rulers, dukes, counts and bishops – could rule from the top down, using the old Roman imagery of public power and the early medieval collective legitimation which was assembly politics, without considering in a very organised way what was going on locally, unless it involved disloyalty, or an injustice which was so clamorous that it actually reached their ears. The small-scale lordships of the late eleventh and twelfth centuries in France could not afford to be so detached; exactly whom they controlled, and how, mattered much more./
#+end_quote

- Part of the recurring impetus for /reformatio/ (note the author does not explicitly use the term in the book; I am employing it myself for the purpose) is that political systems tend to clash with what Christianity and the Bible preaches.

  /Cluny’s real novelty was that it came to be the mother house for monasteries across half of western Europe, whose main loyalties were to Cluny, and not to any local figure, whether bishop or count; it created an international network of identity and elaborate liturgical ritual which cut across all traditional political boundaries, and which would be the model for plenty of monastic orders later as well./

#+begin_quote
  /Even today, a surprising number of historians turn their accounts of the church ‘reform’ period of the later eleventh century into a triumphal narrative, with goodies and baddies – even, remarkably, historians writing in the Protestant tradition, a tradition which regards clerical marriage and lay participation in the choice of ecclesiastics as actively virtuous./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In the eleventh century, political power became more localised, and more carefully bounded. Its holders were often smaller figures than any Carolingian aristocrat would have recognised as an equal. Lords could be creative in its construction, as indeed could cities, grabbing rights in a way that was initially illegal, but, once accepted, defined a new legality. This power structure was new; it maintained plenty of continuities with the past (particularly in a network of aristocratic values which hardly changed), but from now on this sort of practical power depended on a knowledge of, and a concern for, detailed rights and relationships on the ground./

#+begin_quote
  /Peasants are highly averse to risk, and going off to seek one’s fortune in unknown countries has seldom appealed to them, before the great nineteenth-century colonisations. But the extension of the European political network eastwards, through the conquest and/or Christianisation of the Slav and Hungarian lands, themselves often underpopulated, made it possible to see that a future in what is now Poland, for example, was less like stepping off the edge of the map./
#+end_quote

- While it is true that lords can and did extract large demands from the peasants, in general it wasn't as lopsided as usually portrayed. Peasant communities banded together to demand franchises, which helped them gain reasonable terms from their lords.

  /It is often still thought that an active exchange economy needs coins. This is not true; credit is enormously important in most exchange systems, then as now, and debt-credit agreements can be complicated without any physical money changing hands at all.

#+end_quote

- Author notes that despite the usual impression, medieval international exchange system wasn't particularly advanced enough that it could've caused Industrial Revolution much earlier if not for the Black Death.
- Europe is simply a periphery in the international mercantile system, of which Central and East Asia is the center. Even in the Mediterranean, until the 14th century, the primary trading hub is Egypt.
- In addition, the international exchange of goods is mostly a luxury trade. Most people bought and sold goods at the local level.

  /The UN expanded further and more rapidly than its founders had thought possible. But it remained suspended between its twin functions as great power talking shop and supporter of national self-determination across the world. What had started out as a mechanism for defending and adapting empire in an increasingly nationalist age has turned into a global club of national states, devoid of any substantial strategic purpose beyond the almost forgotten one of preventing another world war.

  /Like the League, the UN was basically a cooperative grouping of independent states. Explicit where the League was implicit, it rested on the doctrine of the sovereign equality of its members. Yet despite the utopian rhetoric of its supporters, the UN represented a deliberate retreat from the League’s comparative egalitarianism back to the great power conclaves of the past. The General Assembly had, in general, less power than the League’s assembly had done and the five permanent members of the Security Council had more. They were equipped with their new veto-wielding prerogative, and to facilitate the policing role that Roosevelt had emphasized, they also gave themselves the power to call on their own military staff to coordinate security measures for the sake of world peace. In other words, the UN, even morenthan the League, was to be run by the great powers and far less confidence was reposed in international law as a set of norms independent from, and standing above, power politics./

- In the 1920s, Germany and the Soviet Union formed a military collaboration. For the Soviet Union, it was meant to introduce western military technologies to the Soviet Army. And for Germany, they primarily positioned military training and production within the Soviet territory in order to evade Versailles restrictions on rearmament.
- In 1939, Stalin initiated talks with Britain and France for a defense pact against Nazi Germany. The Western nations were lukewarm on the offer. They also had different expectations for the alliance; the West wants a diplomatic deterrent against Hitler, but the Soviet Union wants an actual war coalition to fight Germany head-on.
- The offer for alliance fell apart when the Soviets realized how little the West's military preparations were, not to mention how unwilling Britain and France are to match Soviet military strength. At around this same time, Germany began reaching out to the Soviet Union for a possible non-aggression pact, which  ultimately became the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.



* THE END OF EMPIRES AND A WORLD REMADE
** /Martin Thomas/

- Main argument: Decolonization is a "globally connected process".
- The end of empires, and globalization, are codependent with each other.n
- The idea of decolonization is framed on Western imperialist terms. Independence movements inadvertently campaigned for self-governance, but with the same hierarchical system imposed by the colonizers.
- Imperial protectionism worsened the effects of the Depression especially in the colonial territories. Most colonies experienced famine in the 1930s due to such policies.
- Overlaps in language and ideology of anticolonialism and communism enabled the mixture of both, and indeed postwar anticolonial movements and figures are often Marxists too. The structure and methods of communist organizations also became crucial in spreading the idea of decolonization.
- The Nazi regime and anticolonial movements found a common cause in opposing the allied empires. They had loose alliances of convenience during the War.
- Author endorses the concept of a greater Second World War.
- I like how it elaborated on the postwar Huk rebellion in the Philippines. I didn't expect the author to devote a couple of paragraphs on the topic, and it's a concise and fair treatment too.
- Postwar decolonization violence was fueled by both war-related economic hardships and general anticolonial sentiment.
- The British Empire distrusted the un, and resolved to hold on to their territories despite wave of anticolonial movements.
- The British envisioned a Malayan union, but was faced with opposition from various ethnic groups. Ethnic Malays did not want a union with migrant groups. Indians and Chinese, especially in Singapore, faced greater hardship during the war than ethnic Malays, causing animosity with the Malay and the British.
- War-related hardships endured by the ethnic Chinese pushed them into communist movements. This, in turn, gave the British a cause to demonize them, claiming that the Chinese are bringing in a foreign anomaly (communism) into Malaya, thereby further fueling ethnic Malay hatred towards the Chinese population.
- The author contends that partition is direct consequence of decolonization.
- In Kenya, British colonialists promoted the image of underground protest movements as being related to satanic activities and witchcraft.
- Decolonization in Southern Africa was spearheaded not by the black African majority, but by the white minority that insists on apartheid policy despite widespread opposition locally and globally.
- France tried to hide the severity of its war in Algeria by means of social policies, but ultimately the truth of the violence flooded global consciousness and made it impossible to prevent Algerian call for independence.
- Colonial mindset seeped through even in national branches of international organizations. the French Red Cross secretly refused to channel aid to Algerians.
- Colonial technocrats imposed Western standards of development onto the colonies, without regard for local customs and practices. this is in line with the arguments presented in James Scott's Seeing Like a State.
- Damages caused by large scale colonial development - especially environmental and agricultural damages - greatly amplified anticolonial sentiment
- The Bretton Woods system poured money into the decolonizing countries, and promoted global free trade, mostly to the advantage of richer countries.

  /Imperialism’s transcontinental presence lent opposition to empire, whether wholeheartedly anticolonial or not, an equally global character. From African American civil rights workers and other political campaigners within the Black Atlantic to medical humanitarians and civil society networks in the communist ‘Second World’ and on to refugee groups and student activists from Palestine to Vietnam, opposition to white supremacy, imperialism, and settler colonialism forged connections that gave decolonization a singular aspect as a global fight against the injustice intrinsic to colonialism./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In the imperial rhetoric of decolonization’s wars, restoring order meant the resumption of whatever sociopolitical plans, economic projects, or other modernization schemes were interrupted by conﬂict. The priority was to limit the fallout from the exposure of rights abuses, not to question the actions that produced them as counterinsurgency drives unfolded. The logic of ‘order before reform’ was trotted out as stock justifcation for late colonial counterinsurgency until global audiences refused to believe it. But imperial powers felt less need to defend the legal arrangements and security apparatus intrinsic to colonies’ violent liminal condition at other times. Instead, the everyday violence of colonialism was just that: a normative standard with supposedly structural causes rather than a massive agglomeration of civilian maltreatment./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Sometimes the actions of insurgents and counterinsurgents are better understood as a bargaining process in which those involved tried to secure additional inﬂuence over government. Temporary alliances and local deals cut across supposedly binary divides between imperial security forces and insurgents. From Malaya to Algeria, defiance by rebels of a leadership ‘line’, oﬀers of money to fghters willing to surrender, and even changing sides were sufciently commonplace to be integrated into security force strategy. Viewed in this light, the job of colonial security forces was not to defeat insurgents outright but to restrict dissent to levels that enabled administration and economic activity to continue./

  /Patterns of protest in newly independent nations were remarkably similar in the decades after independence, with food riots, demonstrations by excluded ethnic minorities, and demands for the fulfllment of decolonization pledges predominating as causes of social unrest. At a deeper level, the distribution of political power in numerous former colonial dependencies could be characterized as variants of state capitalism. For all the leftist leanings of erstwhile anticolonial movements that took ofce after the withdrawal of European rulers, few governments in postcolonial nations sustained early commitments to redistribution. Many proved equally unwilling to invest in more social-democratic alternatives of a mixed economy built around a private sector whose growth would be encouraged by selective governmental support. Instead, the Cold War returned to Africa with a vengeance in the 1970s and 1980s, heightened superpower interventionism manifested in proxy wars and deteriorating standards of governance./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Anticolonialism makes sense as a unifying abstraction, an expression of opposition to something ethically indefensible, rather than as unswerving support for a particular national form. The idea that, one after another, colonies would become nations ignores the multiplicity of viewpoints and the alternatives in play. Imperial and nationalist conceptions of bounded sovereignty jarred with the pluralistic arrangements and local improvisations that had enabled empires to survive despite the weakness of their structures and the porousness of their borderlands. Transnational connections, cosmopolitan inﬂuences, and diﬀering layers of attachment to kin, community, faith, and locality were everywhere diferent, yet always the same in exposing the myth of nationalism triumphant./

  /Imperialist thinking shaped ideas about how sovereign statehood should be constituted and when independent nations should be recognized. Its traces were evident in everything from the constitutional plans of late colonial reformists and the calamities of partition to the developmental projects and human rights discourses promoted by supranational agencies and NGOs in the 1960s and beyond. The decolonizing world was assigned junior status within this global political geography, its elevation to full integration dependent on foreign-led modernization, capital investment, and technology transfer./

- Gamal Abdel Nasser's 1952 coup successfully ended the 140-year rule of the Alawiyya dynasty. King Farouk was forced to abdicate and exiled to Europe. Naseer's Free Officers took the helm, marking the first time in 2500 years that Egypt is ruled by a native Egyptian.

- Anti-French guerilla operations began in 1947, and gradually intensified over the years. A failed operation against French police and military infrastructure in 1954 lead to increasingly violent and indiscriminate reprisals against the Muslim population.
- By 1955, the insurgency became a full-blown conflict, as the FLN began mass attacks against the white civilians. It reached even higher escalation in 1956 when the French government authorized conscription and called up reservists to quell the Algerian nationalist movement.
- As the conflict dragged on, metropolitan France was plagued by economic hardships, which lead to successive governments collapsing and long periods without one. The military became increasingly agitated, and boiled over in May 1958 with the murder of French conscripts in Algeria.

- A mutiny caused split in the leadership. Patrice Lumumba became convinced that Belgium wanted to take back control of Congo. He appointed his personal aide, Joseph Mobutu, to help stamp the mutiny.
- Getting increasingly agitated, Lumuba first turned against the Belgians, then the UN, and ultimately asked for assistance from the Soviet Union.
- Lumumba may have genuinely feared the possibilities of further chaos and even invasion at the time. Still, he managed to appear vindictive, irrational, and even dangerous, to so many parties involved. They all privately agreed on one conclusion: Lumumba has to be eliminated.
- The CIA was indeed involved in the planning of the assasination, with the blessing of Eisenhower himself.
- Lumumba was arrested and thrown into the hands of the secessionist government in Katanga, assisted by Belgian armed personnel. He and his companions were beaten and tortured, then brought to a secluded outside Katanga.
- On the night of 17 January 1961, Patrice Lumumba and two others were shot by a firing squad led by a Belgian officer. They were buried in a prepared grave, but later their remains were dug up and disposed of elsewhere.
- The chaos further worsened, now coupled with international condemnation of Lumumba's death. In 1965, Joseph Mobutu staged a coup and declared himself president.

Many whites feared that South Africa might be on the verge of revolution. An outburst of international condemnation added to the atmosphere of crisis. Western attitudes towards South Africa, hitherto ambivalent, became markedly more hostile. A United Nations Security Council resolution blamed South Africa’s racial policies for causing ‘international friction’. Foreign investors, fearing imminent upheaval, deserted in droves./

- From the 1940s, the African National Congress under Nelson Mandela has championed anti-apartheid cause and equal rights for all, blacks and whites. He wished to achieve the ANC's goals through non-violent means like workers' strikes and boycotts.
- In 1961, the failure of a national strike led Mandela to consider using violence against the apartheid regime. He formed a splinter group that engaged in sabotage activities, though their works were too small-scale and amateurish to cause significant disturbance.
- Mandela and his colleagues were arrested and tried in 1963. He led his and his group's defense counsel, delivering impassioned speeches that gained him international fame. They were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964.

  /The honeymoon of African independence was brief but memorable. African leaders, riding the crest of popularity, stepped forward with energy and enthusiasm to tackle the tasks of development and nation-building; ambitious plans were launched; bright young men went quickly to the top. Expectations were high; the sense of euphoria had been raised to ever greater heights by the lavish promises of nationalist politicians campaigning for power, pledging to provide education, medical care, employment and land for all./

  /The march of African nationalism seemed invincible. Africa, so it was thought, once freed from colonial rule, was destined for an era of unprecedented progress. African leaders even spoke of building new societies that might offer the world at large an inspiration./
#+end_quote

- African independence sentiments were aided by the fortunate circumstances prevailing at the time. African economies were in upward movement, harvests were bountiful throughout the 1950s, and interest in African studies all over the world was very high, following the discovery of the oldest hominids in Olduvai Gorge in Tanganyika in 1959.
- Nationalist leaders like Kwame Nkrumah opted for an African brand of socialism, positing it as antidote to Western colonialism. They were also influenced by the success of left-leaning European governments in establishing welfare states after WW2.
- Both the Soviet Union and China showed active interest in supporting revolutionary movements in Africa. The Soviet Union supplied arms and money to rebel groups, while Cuba recruited the Argentinian guerilla leader Che Guevara to train African rebels.

  /Political systems too were recent transplants. Africans had little experience of representative democracy – representative institutions were introduced by the British and the French too late to alter the established character of the colonial state. The more durable imprint they left behind was of authoritarian regimes in which governors and their officials wielded enormous personal power. The sediment of colonial rule lay deep in African society. Traditions of autocratic governance, paternalism and dirigism were embedded in the institutions the new leaders inherited./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The most difficult task facing Africa’s new leaders was to weld into nations a variety of different peoples, speaking different languages and at different stages of political and social development. The new states of Africa were not ‘nations’. They possessed no ethnic, class or ideological cement to hold them together, no strong historical and social identities upon which to build. For a relatively brief period, the anti-colonial cause had provided a unity of purpose. Nationalist leaders had successfully exploited a variety of grievances among the urban and rural populations to galvanise support for the cause. But once the momentum that they had achieved in their drive for independence began to subside, so other loyalties and ambitions came thrusting to the fore./

- Africans tended to stick with communities of their own ethnic groups, especially when migrating to towns and cities. Specific jobs became dominated by specific ethnicities, who recruited people of their own group. Even political parties were formed along ethnic lines, each ethnic groups having their own parties to advance their welfare.

#+begin_quote
  /Stage by stage, African leaders accumulated ever greater personal power, spreading the tentacles of their control into the further reaches of society. They preferred to rule not through constitutions or through state institutions like parliament but by exercising vast systems of patronage. Parliaments, where they survived, were packed with supporters, chosen for their known obedience. Government bureaucracies were staffed by party loyalists. Trade unions and farmers’ organisations were subordinated to the interests of government. The press existed merely as an outlet for government propaganda. Political debate became a matter of platitudes and praise-songs, no longer taken seriously./
#+end_quote

- The huge supply of manpower, coupled with massive demand for public and private employment, was exploited by newly-independent African leaders for patronage politics, favoring party loyalty and ethnic identity in handing out jobs and aid.

  /It was often said that, because of the internal tensions and rivalries afflicting most African states, only strong government could provide the stability they needed to develop and prosper. Yet in practice, strong governments of the kind employed in Africa – whether personal dictatorships or one-party systems – rarely ensured either political stability or effective administration. Once in power, African leaders became preoccupied with staying in power, employing whatever means were necessary./

  /Despite the promising start made at independence in 1960, Nigeria was soon engulfed by an intense struggle between the country’s three main political parties for supremacy over the federal government. Control of the federal government determined the allocation of development resources. Because each region produced its own political party dominated by the major ethnic group based there, the struggle turned into ethnic combat. Politicians on all sides whipped up ethnic fear, suspicion and jealousy for their own advantage and to entrench themselves in power. Tribalism became the ideology of politics./

- Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe, in 1966, released A Man of the People, which tells of an African leader's reign that ends in an army coup. Coincidentally, that same week a coup overthrew the Northern-led government of Nigeria.
- The chaos of 1966 fueled the secession of Biafra the following year. It garnered worldwide attention and received large scale relief aid. The international support, however, was not enough to save Biafra, and in 1970 the embattled republic surrendered.

  /The First, unlike the Second World War, saw no systematic displacement of populations, no deliberate starvation, no expropriation, little massacre or atrocity. It was, despite the efforts by state propaganda machines to prove otherwise, and the cruelties of the battlefield apart, a curiously civilised war./

  /Yet it damaged civilisation, the rational and liberal civilisation of the European enlightenment, permanently for the worse and, through the damage done, world civilisation also. Pre-war Europe, imperial though it was in its relations with most of the world beyond the continent, offered respect to the principles of constitutionalism, the rule of law and representative government. Post-war Europe rapidly relinquished nconfidence in such principles./

- Author considers the Armenian genocide to have been more closely related to the Ottoman Imperial system than to the greater context of the First World War.
- Totalitarianism, in its modern concept tied to the word, is a product of the Great War.

#+begin_quote
  /There was, admittedly, a fear of war in the abstract, but it was as vague as the perception of what form modern war itself might take. Stronger by far, particularly among the political classes in every major country, was the fear of the consequences of failure to face the challenge of war itself.

Peace, temporarily at least, was in each case the outcome; the ideal of supranational peacemaking, towards which the Hague Conference had pointed the way, was in no case invoked./

#+begin_quote
  /All European armies in 1904 had long-laid military plans, notable in most cases for their inflexibility. None was integrated with what today would be called a ‘national security policy’, made in conclave between politicians, diplomats, intelligence directors and service chiefs, and designed to serve a country’s vital interests, for such a concept of national leadership did not then exist. Military plans were held to be military secrets in the strictest sense, secret to the planners alone, scarcely communicable in peacetime to civilian heads of government, often not from one service to another./

  /The ‘Schlieffen Plan’, so-called after its architect, was the most important government document written in any country in the first decade of the twentieth century; it might be argued that it was to prove the most important official document of the last hundred years, for what it caused to ensue on the field of battle, the hopes it inspired, the hopes it dashed, were to have consequences that persist to this day./
#+end_quote

- The Schlieffen Plan, ambitious and well-crafted as it was, ultimately remained deeply flawed until its implementation. Until the end of his life, Schlieffen agonized with how to transport all the troops needed for a lightning victory, in a short period of time, within the cramped space between northern France and Germany.
- Author notes that full details of Serbian govenrment's involvement in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand II is not established. I think The Sleepwalkers does show how closely connected it is. Nevertheless, Austria-Hungary let its inherent suspicion (or hatred) of Serbia to frame its judgment on how to respond.
- The author is of the opinion that had Austria-Hungary retaliated immediately, the rest of Europe would have tolerated it at the minimum. The argument hinges on an immediate attack not being reliant on Germany's tacit support, which would've triggered certain alliances and treaties.

  /Information arrived fitfully, sometimes much, sometimes little, but was always incomplete. There was no way of correlating and displaying it, as there is in modern crisis management centres. Even had there been, it is not certain that the crisis of 1914 would have been managed any better than it was. Modern communication systems may overload those who seek to be informed through them, so consuming time necessary for thought; underload, in 1914, consumed time as men puzzled to fill in the gaps between the facts they had. Time, in all crises, is usually the ingredient missing to make a solution. It is best supplied by an agreement on a pause./

- In the wake of German Army's destruction of Louvain, and its subsequent condemnation by academics and intellectuals worldwide, 93 German intellectual figures penned a manifesto defending the German conduct and affirming support for the war.

  /At the outset, the advantage lay with the attackers, as long as they could preserve a measure of secrecy, a diminishing possibility as the war prolonged and defenders learnt how greatly survival depended upon surveillance and alertness. Almost as soon as the attackers entered the enemy’s positions, however, the advantage tended to move towards the defenders, who knew the ground, which the attackers did not, had prepared fall-back positions, and were retreating towards their own artillery along, if lucky, intact telephone lines. The attackers found themselves in exactly the opposite situation, moving into unknown and confusing surroundings, and away from their supporting artillery the further they advanced, thus progressively losing contact with it as telephone lines were broken or left behind. Then, when the defenders counter-attacked, the advantage reversed. The attackers had familiarised themselves with the ground taken, organised its defences, to their advantage but the enemy’s confusion, and re-established telephonic communication with their artillery. In this see-saw, functional and structural weaknesses disfavoured first one side, then the other, to the eventual frustration of all effort to break through to open country or break back to the original line of defence. The physical product of offence and counter-offence was an ever thicker and more confused trench line, resembling a layer of scar tissue, picked at and irritated, over the site of an unsuccessful surgical operation./

  /It is difficult today not to sympathise with the condemnations, worse or better informed as they have been, of the generals of the First World War. In no way – appearances, attitude, spoken pronouncement, written legacy – do they commend themselves to modern opinion or emotion. The impassive expressions that stare back at us from contemporary photographs do not speak of consciences or feelings troubled by the slaughter over which those men presided, nor do the circumstances in which they chose to live: the distant chateau, the well-polished entourage, the glittering motor cars, the cavalry escorts, the regular routine, the heavy dinners, the uninterrupted hours of sleep. Joffre’s two-hour lunch, Hindenburg’s ten-hour night, Haig’s therapeutic daily equitation along roads sanded lest his horse slip, the Stavka’s diet of champagne and court gossip, seem and were a world away from the cold rations, wet boots, sodden uniforms, flooded trenches, ruined billets and plague of lice on, in and among which, in winter at least, their subordinates lived./

- Three counterarguments to criticism of First World War generals:
  - Contrary to popular belief, the generals were themselves exposed to danger from time to time. In fact, dozens of generals were killed during the War.
  - A headquarters far from the battlefield is much better as vantage point for commanding the vast armies of the War.
  - Communications systems in the First World War were slow and inefficient, and dependent on infrastructure directly on the line of fire, hence dangerous to set up and maintain.

#+begin_quote
  /Most of the accusations laid against the generals of the Great War – incompetence and incomprehension foremost among them – may therefore be seen to be misplaced. The generals, once those truly incompetent, uncomprehending and physically or emotionally unfit had been discarded, which they were at the outset, came in the main to understand the war’s nature and to apply solutions as rational as was possible within the means to hand. Robbed of the ability to communicate once action was joined, they sought to overcome the obstacles and accidents that would inevitably arise in the unfolding of battle by ever more elaborate anticipation and predisposition. Plans were drawn which laid down minute-by-minute manoeuvre by the infantry and almost yard-by-yard concentration of artillery fire, in an attempt not so much to determine as to predestine the outcome. The attempt was, of course, vain. Nothing in human affairs is predestinable, least of all in an exchange of energy as fluid and dynamic as a battle. While battle-altering resources – reliable armoured, cross-country vehicles, portable two-way radio – lay beyond their grasp (and they did so, tantalisingly, only in a development time to be measured in a few years), the generals were trapped within the iron fetters of a technology all too adequate for mass destruction of life but quite inadequate to restore to them the flexibilities of control that would have kept destruction of life within bearable limits./

* THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH
** /Richard Dawkins/

- Theory has two clashing definitions: system of statements considered as facts; and hypothesis yet to be conclusively proven. Evolution is a theory in the first sense of the word. However, the second sense is what theory is commonly defined as. This is used as ammo by anti-evolution crowd in discrediting the concept.
- Facts are proven differently in science and in math. The process of proving in mathematics is much more rigorous and demonstrable.
- Dawkins notes that the first dogs are self-domesticated wolves. As food source became stable, wolves became less risk-averse, having less tendency to flee while eating, and hence more tame.
- Pleiotropy
- There is more than sufficient evidence for evolution even without fossil record. The presence or absence of such is largely irrelevant to the theory of evolution. The discovery of fossil is mostly just a bonus, and gaps in the fossil record is not enough to disprove evolution.
- This also means that absence of the so-called missing link between primates and humans is not a disproof of evolution. In fact, it's not necessary at all to prove evolution, which is already true with or without such a missing link.
- There are so-called pseudogenes that don't do anything but still exist within the genetic makeup.
- Flightless birds in New Zealand aren't flightless just because of lack of predator. In fact, the ancestors of moa are already flightless even before reaching new zealand when it was still part of Gondwana.
- Dawkins contends that there isn't a plausible theory for the origin of life, and it's for the better that the subject remain a mystery. If such a highly plausible theory exists, then life in other planets should be more common.



* THE INVENTION OF SCIENCE
** /David Wootton/

#+begin_quote
  /Modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe saw a nova, or new star, and 1704, when Newton published his Opticks, which demonstrated that white light is made up of light of all the colours of the rainbow, that you can split it into its component colours with a prism, and that colour inheres in light, not in objects. There were systems of knowledge we call ‘sciences’ before 1572, but the only one which functioned remotely like a modern science, in that it had sophisticated theories based on a substantial body of evidence and could make reliable predictions, was astronomy, and it was astronomy that was transformed in the years after 1572 into the first true science. What made astronomy in the years after 1572 a science? It had a research programme, a community of experts, and it was prepared to question every long-established certainty (that there can be no change in the heavens, that all movement in the heavens is circular, that the heavens consist of crystalline spheres) in the light of new evidence. Where astronomy led, other new sciences followed./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Those who accept Darwin’s theory of evolution can have no patience with a Biblical chronology which places the creation of the world 6,000 years ago, but what we may term historical humankind (humans who have left written records behind them), as opposed to archaeological humankind (humans who have left only artefacts behind them), has existed only for about that length of time, some 300 generations./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The nova of 1572 was not the cause of the Scientific Revolution, any more than the bullet which killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914 was the cause of the First World War. Nevertheless, the nova marks, quite precisely, the beginning of the Revolution, as the death of the archduke marks the beginning of the war. For the Aristotelian philosophy of nature could not be adapted to incorporate this peculiar anomaly; if there could be such a thing as a new star, then the whole system was founded on false premises./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /But since 1572 the world has been caught up in a vast Scientific Revolution that has transformed the nature of knowledge and the capacities of humankind. Without it there would have been no Industrial Revolution and none of the modern technologies on which we depend; human life would be drastically poorer and shorter and most of us would live lives of unremitting toil. How long it will last, and what its consequences will be, it is far too soon to say; it may end with nuclear war, or ecological catastrophe, or (though this seems much less likely) with happiness, peace and prosperity. Yet although we can now see that it is the greatest event in human history since the Neolithic Revolution, there is no general agreement on what the Scientific Revolution is, why it happened – or even whether there was such a thing. In this respect the Scientific Revolution is quite unlike, for example, the First World War, where there is general agreement on what it was and a fair amount of agreement on why it happened. An ongoing revolution is a nuisance for historians: they prefer to write about revolutions that happened in the past – when, in reality, this one is still continuing all around us./
#+end_quote

- The notion of the 17th century Scientific Revolution as /the/ Scientific Revolution is very recent, dating back to the 1950s. Prior to that, there were two Scientific Revolutions: one with Newton's classical physics, and one with Rutherford's nuclear physics.
- The main thesis is that Scientific Revolution is defined by the similar revolution in language.
- Scientific Revolution was less about ideas, and more about the experience.
- The author seems to emphasize the relationship of language and science in the history of modern science.
- Two critical factors to repudiating old theories on the shape of the earth:
  - The discovery of the new world is sponsored by kings, so the issue has become a part of political realm, not just a philosophical debate.
  - The discovery added *new* knowledge; old theories relied on interpretation of *old* knowledge and theories.
- The scientific revolution involved the mathematization of nature. Perspective drawing, cartography, and ballistics were areas where mathematics found great practical use.
- By the time Galileo started studying the heavens, telescopes have been in use by lots of people. What gave Galileo the edge is his constant tinkering to improve his telescope, especially its magnification.
- While experimentation is not a new thing, what was new in the Scientific Revolution is the collaborative method of doing science. Various scientists kept constant communication with each other, and preformed experiments, published results, and others built on these previous works to improve on their own experiments.
- Alchemy was defeated by open and public practice of science. Experiments have to be replicable, communicated in clear language. This was the opposite of alchemy, which insisted on secrecy and obscurity.

#+begin_quote
  /To a certain degree, if the world is orderly and predictable, it is because we have worked to make it so by developing technologies that give us control over nature. If we can model its processes, it is because we have developed our own capacities for making nature-like artefacts. It was therefore inevitable that the advocates of the experimental method in the seventeenth century would come to insist that the universe is like a clock, for clocks are embodiments of the principles of order, regularity and efficiency and, moreover, it is we who have made them. If we think of God as a clockmaker, then we can be confident that he will have made a world amenable to experimental enquiry. In the Middle Ages the heavens had been compared to clockwork; now the same principle of regularity was, it was claimed, to be discovered in the sublunary world./
#+end_quote

- The analogy of God as a clockmaker, and the universe as a clockwork, began in the 17th century. It's interesting that such an analogy was even made, as clocks in the 17th century aren't very reliable.

  /The point about evidence is not that it was a natural type of argument to rely on, nor that it was a sort of argument that was obviously bound to be successful; the point is that relying on evidence just happened to work rather well./

  /The intellectual apparatus of the new science – facts, experiments, theories, laws of nature, evidence – did not establish its worth by philosophical arguments; its success depended upon the fact that, in practice, it produced good results. There may be inhabited worlds in which no culture ever becomes evidence-based; and there could, for all we know, be universes in which looking for evidence simply doesn’t pay off – in which the sceptics not only win the arguments but have the facts on their side. Reality and the new science happened, in certain areas of physics, to dovetail quite neatly together. This was, in the end, good luck./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /We do not just live with the technological benefits of science: the modern scientific way of thinking has become so much part of our culture that it has now become difficult to think our way back into a world where people did not speak of facts, hypotheses and theories, where knowledge was not grounded in evidence, where nature did not have laws. The Scientific Revolution has become almost invisible simply because it has been so astonishingly successful./

* THE KING'S TWO BODIES
** /Ernst Kantorowicz/

#+begin_quote
  /Mysticism, when transposed from the warm twilight of myth and fiction to the cold searchlight of fact and reason, has usually little left to recommend itself. Its language, unless resounding within its own magic or mystic circle, will often appear poor and even slightly foolish, and its most baffling metaphors and highflown images, when deprived of their iridescent wings, may easily resemble the pathetic and pitiful sight of Baudelaire's Albatross. Political mysticism in particular is exposed to the danger of losing its spell or becoming quite meaningless when taken out of its native surroundings, its time and its space./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Infinite cross-relations between Church and State, active in every century of the Middle Ages, produced hybrids in either camp. Mutual borrowings and exchanges of insignia, political symbols, prerogatives, and rights of honor had been carried on perpetually between the spiritual and secular leaders of Christian society. The pope adorned his tiara with a golden crown, donned the imperial purple, and was preceded by the imperial banners when riding in solemn procession through the streets of Rome. The emperor wore under his crown a mitre, donned the pontifical shoes and other clerical raiments, and received, like a bishop, the ring at his coronation. These borrowings affected, in the earlier Middle Ages, chiefly the ruling individuals, both spiritual and secular, until finally the/ sacerdotium /had an imperial appearance and the/ regnum /a clerical touch./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The implication of all this is not that the lawyers consciously borrowed from the acts of the early Councils, but that the fiction of the King’s Two Bodies produced interpretations and definitions which perforce would resemble those produced in view of the Two Natures of the God-man. Anyone familiar with the christological discussions of the early centuries of the Christian era will be struck by the similarity of speech and thought in the Inns of Court on the one hand, and in the early Church Councils on the other; also, by the faithfulness with which the English jurists applied, unconsciously rather than consciously, the current theological definitions to the defining of the nature of kingship. Taken all by itself, this transference of definitions from one sphere to another, from theology to law, is anything but surprising or even remarkable. The quid pro quo method—the taking over of theological notions for defining the state—has been going on for many centuries, just as, vice versa, in the early centuries of the Christian era the imperial political terminology and the imperial ceremonial had been adapted to the needs of the Church./

- In the context of bishops, the concept of /persona mixta/ is representation of the bishop as both a man of the Church and a vassal of the King.
- The King was also treated as /persona mixta/, at least until it was formally repudiated by the Church. But at the time of the Norman Anonymous, the concept is still widely accepted.

#+begin_quote
  /With the King’s Two Bodies the doctrine of the persona mixta seems to have no direct relation. The duplication expressed by the concept of the persona mixta refers to temporal and spiritual capacities, but does not refer to bodies natural and politic. Or could it be that the king’s impersonal and immortal super-body appeared, during the earlier Middle Ages, in some way or the other, embedded in that very idea of his spiritual character resulting from the clericalization of the royal office? In fact, it is in that direction that the Norman Anonymous, one of staunchest defenders of the spiritual essence of a Christ-like kingship, sends us, and we can do nothing better than to take his hint and follow his guidance./
#+end_quote

- The kings of the Old Testament were Christ's foreshadowers. After Christ, the kings now became imitations. But ultimately, the kings before and after Christ all bore the same dual identity, albeit imperfectly and by virtue of grace.
- The Norman Anonymous took the concept of duality to a lot of extremities, even ascribing this /persona mixta/ to pagan Roman emperors.

#+begin_quote
  /Norman author’s vision of the king as a persona geminata is ontological and, as an effluence of a sacramental and liturgical action performed at the altar, it is liturgical as well. His vision is, on the whole, more closely related to the liturgy, to the holy action which itself is image and reality at the same time, than to the distinction of functional capacities and constitutional competencies, or to the concepts of office and dignity as opposed to man./

- A good way of measuring growth of Latin Europe is through the bishoprics.

#+begin_quote
  /Latin Christendom consisted of those churches worshipping in Latin and according to a rite approved by the papacy, usually the Roman rite. One of the striking features of the western Church is, in fact, its insistence on the dominance of one liturgical language and one cultic form. There are a few dubious or borderline cases, where special circumstances allowed other languages or rites within the Roman obedience, but these were few in number and diminished over time./
#+end_quote

- The Christians in Europe increasingly referred to themselves as the Latin Christians, and their world is the Latin Christendom.

#+begin_quote
  /'Latin’ was a name which adherents of the Latin rite and Roman obedience applied to themselves, but it is hard to credit the Latin liturgy itself with expansionary power. Indeed, one aspect of the expansion we are discussing seems to be the imposition of that liturgy on Christian regions of divergent tradition by the papacy and other interested groups; and if the spread of the liturgy is conceived of as a consequence of the expansionary movement, it is hard also to have it as a cause./

  /The mere existence of the institution is not enough to account for the rise of the papal monarchy. The papacy is best seen as an enterprising and initiatory institution, but one that made its greatest mark by taking advantage of changes in the world around it. The great popes of the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries did indeed have a consciously pursued goal of ‘extending the bounds of the Church’, but they did so in a world where dynamic growth of a material kind was already afoot./

#+begin_quote
  /Mere adherence to the Latin liturgy and obedience to Rome were not enough to qualify for full inclusion in the ecclesia, that is, in society. As the men of Frankish Europe intruded upon societies around and unlike their own, they found both non-Christians (in eastern Europe and the Mediterranean lands) and local variants of Christianity (notably in the Celtic countries). Their response was to equate the two, if the Christian societies did not have the social and legal characteristics with which they were familiar. The expansion of the High Middle Ages was a matter not simply of Latin Christendom growing, but of the territorial growth of a certain kind of society. It tended to describe itself as Roman and Christian, but also recognized the Celtic lands as alien to it. By the eleventh century ‘Latin Christendom’ can be used to designate not merely a rite or an obedience but a society./

- The High Middle Ages was a period of aristocratic diaspora. Many gained and settled in new territories through the crusades. But some also expanded through marriage and alliances.

#+begin_quote
  /One measure of the importance of the expansion of Frankish aristocrats in the High Middle Ages is their role in providing ruling dynasties for Europe. Just as the minor princes of Germany would later provide a useful fund of kings for the new nationalist monarchies of the nineteenth century, so the great families of medieval France sent out offspring to sit on distant thrones./

- Military vassals are easy to get. But land is much scarcer. This scracity can be seen as a factor for aristocratic diaspora, as the nobility searched for lands to possess.

#+begin_quote
  /The more land one had, the more knights one could enfeoff, and the more knights one had, the easier it was to conquer new lands./
#+end_quote

- Feudalism grew out of this aristocratic expansionism. Newcomers build their fiefdom, provide privileges to their knightly retinues, and recruit locals to tend the lands.
- The language of feudalism is mainly loan words, since the system was imposed by immigrant nobilities and knights unto the native population.

  /Levels of hostility between incomer and native obviously varied according to the circumstances of the intrusion and the pre-existing cultural differences between the two groups. The barrier between Christian and non-Christian was normally unbridgeable, but the survival of Muslim aristocracies in some places shows that extermination was not the only path. The intrusive aristocracies of the High Middle Ages had differing relationships with and attitudes to indigenous peoples and cultures and could turn out to be an alien and conquering élite, an élite monopolizing power but receptive to native culture or a group mingling with native aristocrats./

  /There had been fortifications in Europe for millennia and they had taken many different forms. No one set of criteria will differentiate absolutely sharply the fortresses of the early Middle Ages from the castles of the High Middle Ages. There will always be areas of ambiguity and overlap. Nevertheless, if we are content with a characterization of the difference that covers most cases, we can say that the castles which covered Europe in the tenth to twelfth centuries were distinguished by two features – they were small and they were high./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The most distinctive physical feature of castles, their height, was in part a consequence of their size. They were not intended to oppose truly massive earth ramparts to the attacker. They were not places of refuge for whole communities and hence did not have large reserves of manpower for defence. Castles were intended to be defensible by a few and the way to ensure this was to make them small but high. The height gave them both inaccessibility and dominance of their surroundings. Inside a castle, a garrison was hard to get at but could also command everything within sight./
#+end_quote

- Improved fortifications through castles was matched by improvements in siege warfare, namely the development of siege machinery like catapults and trebuchets.
- Military techniques spread through 3 ways: conquest; imitation; and planned development.

#+begin_quote
  /As the military aristocracy of western Europe extended its lordship outwards in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, its members created not only conquest states and colonial societies, but also representations of themselves and their enterprises. These images of conqueror and conquest are enshrined in the histories and charters that their clerical brothers and cousins drew up and in the songs and stories that the aristocracy composed and enjoyed. Written memorials of this kind record the words and gestures of famous conquerors. They elaborate a terminology and rhetoric of expansionary violence. Mythic motifs recur: the first coming of the conquerors; the figure of the heroic military pioneer, perhaps a poor knight or noble, who took the gamble of foreign conquest; the superhuman exploits of the new men. What emerges from such records is the self-image of the conqueror./
#+end_quote

- Medieval conquerors cultivated an image of ferocity in their battles. It can be seen as like glorifying the violence, but that is part of the point. Such image is meant to convey their martial prowess and impose sense of authority.

#+begin_quote
  /The experience of successful conquest and colonization imprinted itself upon the minds of princes, lords and clerics, so that they came to expect or anticipate that the future would see more new lordships created by force, more planned clearance and settlement, ever more income from tribute, taxes, rent and tithes./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Conquest and colonization could thus be represented as a dramatic and formative process and often appeared to participants (or victims) as a distinct, fateful and perhaps heroic story. The very first generation of settlers told tales of their arrival in the new land, portrayed the villains and heroes of the early years and picked out certain moments for mythic treatment. Hence a body of tale, legend and memory was generated, part of which is recoverable because it was transmitted in writing. The conquerors and immigrants produced a literature of conquest./
#+end_quote

- The designation of the term 'Franks' for the crusaders in 1099 isn't a novelty of the First Crusade. Long before that, because of strong associattions with the Carolingian Empire, western European conquerors have been referred to collectively as Franks.

#+begin_quote
  /The term ‘Frank’ thus referred to westerners as settlers or on aggressive expeditions far from home. It is hence entirely appropriate that when the Portuguese and Spaniards arrived off the Chinese coasts in the sixteenth century, the local population called them Fo-lang-ki, a name adapted from the Arabic traders’ Faranǧa. Even in eighteenth-century Canton the western barbarian carried the name of his marauding ancestors./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Population growth is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the expansion of a culture area; for technical and organizational advantages, along with such intangibles as cultural prestige and aggressive drives, can result in the dissemination of a culture without much in the way of demographic change – the partial westernization of Japan, for example, has taken place with absolutely negligible western settlement./
#+end_quote

- Migration also occurred throughout Europe during the High Middle Ages, though distribution is unequal. One particularly large example of migration is with the /Reconquista/ in the Iberian peninsula. The place known then as Al-Andalus was relatively empty. The Latin conquest of the region brought with it the Christian populations that migrated and settled to the new lands, as shown also by the growth of bishoprics after the /Reconquista/.
- Migration was to an extent fairly organized. Kings and lords gifted lands to their loyal vassals. These gifts came with specific terms, like how large the land is, how many can be settled in it, what crops are to be grown, etc.

#+begin_quote
 /The vast movement of new settlement, migration and colonization that took place in the High Middle Ages was based on this model of labour recruitment, not on enserfment or capture. The free village, consciously designed to draw new settlers, could be found everywhere, most notably in the parts of Europe, such as the Iberian peninsula and the lands east of the Elbe, which were opened up to large-scale immigration in this period./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The settlers who came to newly established villages had to be given special conditions and privileges, both to encourage them to come and to enable them to establish themselves. There had to be compensations for the long journey, the severance of family and local ties and, perhaps, the disposal of other property. The new conditions and status that were offered to them on the frontiers of settlement must be a magnet strong enough to break the bonds that held people in place. Then, when the migrants reached their new destination, the early years might be hard and precarious, especially if the settlements were indeed entirely new and the arable had to be created by clearing woodland or draining marsh. Lords had to be ready to surrender some rights and income in the early years in order to ensure that the settlement would become viable and profitable./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The only significant limitation on alienability arose from the lords’ desire to ensure that the purpose of the new plantation, namely the creation of an active and flourishing, but subordinate and rent-paying peasantry, would not be subverted. There was no advantage to them in land speculation, absenteeism or the encroachment of outside grandees. Provisos were thus sometimes made explicit that the new colonists could only alienate their property to someone who would be an acceptable replacement./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The new lands of settlement were, like all of medieval Europe, lands of lords, but they were also, and not necessarily paradoxically, lands of freedom./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /It is clear that many colonists were not landless men, but already peasant farmers in their homelands. Even those who were driven to emigrate by desperate circumstances sometimes had land to sell./

  /Emigration requires resources as well as will, and it has been noticed in some modern migratory movements that the typical migrant is in the middle of the socio-economic range, neither rich nor destitute, and hence with both the incentive and the ability to move and make a new start. Experienced farmers will also have been more attractive than the landless or destitute to lords and others recruiting labour./
#+end_quote

- Migrants are usually people who already have some land and capital, and think that settling into another place can be a profitable endeavor for them. The process of migration itself is relatively costly, and poor peasants do not have the financial capability to move away from their current situation.
- The primary machine of the feudal system is the water mill, used for grinding grains. It is both physically big and expensive, and feudal lords are the most common owners of such, as ordinary settlers do not have the finances for building a mill. The lord can then require the settlers to use the mill for grinding their crops, like corn, and the settlers have to pay for it.

#+begin_quote
  /The new settlers, new ploughs and new mills meant ‘improvement’/ (melioratio terrae), /and ‘improvement’ meant the expansion of cereal cultivation. What was involved was thus not simply a shift from wild to tamed, but a move to a highly particular form of land use. In many parts of Europe the changes of the High Middle Ages involved a step away from a human ecology that could support only a sparse population but exploited a large variety of natural resources, such as fish, honey and game, as well as livestock and cultivated crops, towards a more densely populated monoculture./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /From the point of view of prince, prelate or enterprising locator, of course, the health of the settled population was not central. What was important about planned colonization was that it turned non-revenue-producing resources into a fountain of corn and silver. Richer lords and more peasants – that seems an undeniable outcome of the new settlements of the High Middle Ages./
#+end_quote

- Written sources for feudal life in the High Middle Ages will naturally be skewed towards political, military, and eccesiastical topics. Such sources came from the literate class, and such sources serve the needs of the class that wrote them.
- Peasant life is underrepresented in such written evidence, as the peasants were illiterate, but also because day-to-day life depends on knowledge and skills that the lords do not consider relevant to their personal needs.
- Three main non-written sources: archaeology; village and field morphology; place names.

#+begin_quote
  /The history of rural settlement is a topic which demands the slow accumulation of laboriously recovered data – pottery fragments, charter references, field maps, etc. It is also an area in which new scientific methods, such as the chemical analysis of ceramics or the investigation of plant and animal remains, promise ever richer information of a quite novel kind. If collaborative and multidisciplinary scholarship is allowed to thrive, one eventual result will be a deeper, sharper and livelier picture of the new landscapes of the High Middle Ages./ 
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The twelfth and thirteenth centuries were a period of dramatic urbanization in virtually every part of Europe. The older cities grew population and expanded beyond their Roman or early medieval limits, while hundreds of new towns were established, often as part of a highly self-conscious policy of development./
#+end_quote

- Township in the Middle Ages can be defined in two way: economic and legal. They don't always overlap, which means that medieval urbanization can be viewed in two different ways.
- Urban settlements legally defined as such usually have charters that grant them special privileges, like freedom from feudal control and lower taxes.

#+begin_quote
  /Town freedom – the particular constellation of privileges and liberties associated with urban status – was thus an incentive for settlement even apart from any considerations of commercialization. Immigrants would settle in towns because they sought liberty, not simply because they wished to trade./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The surviving urban charters and laws offer insights into the interests and constraints which shaped the new towns of Europe in the High Middle Ages. To analyse them is to explore the ambitions, fears and intentions of the men who created and expanded these towns. It is possible to see, in their wording and provisions, the end product of negotiations, clashes and concessions between all the parties involved in the formation of new towns – the lord, the urban entrepreneurs, the church and the new colonists. The town charter was a document of great symbolic value representing a new start./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The western European urban model, which was devised in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, involved the privileging of a space and its inhabitants. Such a privileging required, by definition, an author, a lord. But the actual content of the privileges was not usually worked out afresh between each lord and his burgesses. Standardized sets of legal provisions were available by the twelfth century. At the most general level there were some basic principles of urban liberty, such as free status, exemption from tolls and the grant of limited monopolies, which were intrinsic to the very concept of a chartered town. On a more specific level, whole bodies of positive law regarding town administration, civil and criminal procedure and the regulation of economic activity could be borrowed by one town from another. The result was the creation of families of town law, groups of urban settlements whose legal arrangements were, at least initially, modelled on a ‘mother town’./

- Languages are very diverse in the frontier regions of Latin Europe. Bilingualism is not uncommon, arguably even necessary in many instances.

#+begin_quote
  /It would be naive to describe the cultural situation on the frontiers simply in terms of pluralism, diversity or mingling. Languages were not all equal. Some had higher prestige because of the political or economic power of those who spoke them. It is clear, for instance, that it was speakers of Romance and Germanic languages who were spreading through expansionary migration and conquest, while Celtic, Slavic, Baltic and Arabic were losing ground. These developments of the medieval period had a permanent effect on the linguistic map of Europe. There was a strong colonial flavour to this linguistic expansion: German in Livonia and French in Syria were languages of conquest, which might offer privileges to those who mastered them. But the patterns were not simple. Native vernaculars were resistant and could revive. Linguistic change was not all one-way and linguistic conflict could have more than one outcome./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Cultural legislation, even in the modern state, always faces an uphill struggle. In medieval circumstances it cannot have been enforceable. Language change there certainly was, but it was the result of migration and cultural adaptation, not of administrative prescription./

#+begin_quote
  /The long-term trend between the twelfth and the sixteenth centuries was away from personality to territoriality of the law, away from pluralism to uniformity. The road to/ un roi, une loi, une foi /is a long one, but this is certainly a paved section of it./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In any ethnically diverse society political competitors seek to manipulate or harness racial feelings of hostility and solidarity and their success in doing so is shaped not only by the relative numbers and wealth of the different ethnic groups but also by the overall shape of social and political life in the society. Arenas of conflict vary with time and place. In the high medieval peripheries arenas of especial importance were the Church, the princely court and the burgess community./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The mingling of peoples that resulted from high medieval colonial migration did not always juxtapose Christian and non-Christian; it often gave rise to societies in which different Christian ethnic groups lived in contact./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /In these regions where Christian peoples of different law and language intermingled, the Church itself became an arena of ethnic competition. It was indeed one of the most highly charged fields of conflict and there are clear reasons for this. Ecclesiastical offices were profitable and brought power and so were obvious and visible targets for ambition, but more: since the clergy were the carriers of ritual authority, morality and learning, they defined and spoke for a community or group. To see one’s prelates and pastors become strangers in speech and nationality was a loss of voice and a destabilization of identity./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The Church was not simply an institution, but an institution with an avowed mission. Hence no struggle over ecclesiastical office took place without reference, if only tactical, to the duties of clerics, especially those entrusted with the cure of souls. Since pastoral care involved preaching, hearing confession, comforting, advising and condemning, it could only be effectively undertaken by a priest who could communicate with his flock in their vernacular./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Princely courts were, in the best of circumstances, culturally distinct from the surrounding society, centres of patronage, conspicuous consumption, cosmopolitanism and fashion, and their style might easily inflame clerical, puritanical or backwoods critics. If, in addition, a dominant faction at court, or even the ruler himself, were of alien birth or culture, these potential antagonisms would be given a sharper, ethnically phrased tone. By their very nature, princely courts tended to harbour foreign elements. They were the epicentre of political dynasticism, and dynasticism meant that political power was transmitted according to family not national priorities. Hence the recurrent unpredictable trauma of the wooing of foreign brides and the arrival of alien heirs./
#+end_quote

- In the later Middle Ages, some of the great royal families in Eastern Europe died down due to lack of heirs. As a result, their territories passed on to foreign aristocrats, notably the Habsburgs.

#+begin_quote
  /In the later Middle Ages the Muslims of Spain were robbed of their law and gradually lost their language. The culmination of this assault came when they lost their ‘law’ in the deepest sense, their religion, in the forcible conversions of the years around 1500. In the sixteenth century it was their customs that proved unacceptable to the Christian majority. By the opening years of the seventeenth century it had been decided that their very stock, their genus, could no longer be tolerated. In early modern Spain a crucial criterion for promotion and power was ‘purity of blood’, a descent untainted by Jewish or Moorish ancestry. A blood racism of the modern kind had been born./
#+end_quote

- Latin Christianity (aka Roman Catholicism) stands out among other Christian denominations — in the Middle Ages, and beyond — for the primacy of uniformity, both in rite (conduct of Mass in Latin), and in obedience (loyalty to the Bishop of Rome, the Pope).

#+begin_quote
  /While the papacy had enjoyed a position of prestige and centrality in western Europe since the very birth of official Christianity under Constantine, the means and mechanics supporting that position underwent a transformation during and after the eleventh century. Starting with the reform movement of the middle and later years of that century, papal power became greater, papal decisions more enforceable, ritual uniformity more real. One consequence was that Latin Christians identified themselves more often and more deeply as such. Reverence to St Peter, obedience to the pope and commitment to certain forms of worship and church government mingled and intensified./
#+end_quote

- The concept of 'Christendom' has always been about unity of faith. But increasingly during the Middle Ages it has gained a sense of territoriality(lands where Latin Christianity is practiced, by the ruler and by the ruled), and of quasi-ethnicity (racial discrimination of Christians towards non-Christians).

#+begin_quote
  /Crusading military orders, such as the Templars, Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights, were, in part, successful because they were improbable. Their animating idea involved a fusion of opposites. The eleventh-century knight was violent, acquisitive, unruly and lascivious. The eleventh-century monk was dedicated to peace, poverty, obedience and chastity. From these contradictory sources sprang the crusading orders of the twelfth century: knights who were poor, chaste and obedient, monks who were fighters. This combination of aggression and self-abnegation had enormous appeal, and soon these orders became among the wealthiest and most prestigious corporations in Christendom. They were the most powerful and enduring institutional results of the militarization of Christianity that characterized the eleventh and twelfth centuries./
#+end_quote

- Another factor for the success and longevity of crusading orders is their institutional structure. The leaders being non-dynastic means that killing off a leader doesn't have much benefit for the opponents, as they can be replaced quickly. This also ensures somewhat stable continuity, unlike with kingdoms where the death of the monarch can throw the establishment into chaos and infighting.
  - Author uses the phrase "Europeanization of Europe" to describe the political, military, cultural, even religious, changes that Europe underwent in the High Middle Ages. This Europeanization is actually the homogenizing of the continent, rooted in influence coming from France, Germany, and Italy — that is, the old Frankish Empire of Charlemagne.
- Naming children after saints used to be localized. Names of specific saints are popular within the region nearest to that saint's cultic center. Starting in the High Middle Ages, saint names became more widespread outside the usual centers of their cult.
- This naming scheme also shows a conflict between conquering immigrants and conquered natives, as the latter feel pressured to adopt names of saints from the former's home regions.

#+begin_quote
  /The transformation of cult and nomenclature between the tenth and thirteenth centuries was thus not simply a matter of the spread of certain names and saints in the wake of conquest and colonization. This certainly did happen, but it was paralleled and encompassed by the other trend, a shift towards a universalist nomenclature and cult which was more than just a successful localism writ large. Just as the English peasants of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries adopted the names of their lords, so the European populace, when choosing their children’s names, came to favour Mary and the apostles, those aristocrats among the saints./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The university was one of the most powerful instruments of cultural homogeneity to arise in the High Middle Ages. Growing gradually from the schools of logic, law and theology of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, these international centres of learning and education had, by the thirteenth century, acquired something like their modern form: corporate, degree-granting institutions run by teachers who lectured to, disciplined and examined students./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Most of these itinerant students eventually returned home, and the more successful of them attained high ecclesiastical and political positions in their native societies. Thus, by 1300, the non-military élite of the Latin West was being shaped by a standard educational experience. There was a uniformity to their technical language, intellectual habits, pedagogic expectations and teenage memories. By the thirteenth century the great prelates who helped run Europe had a common collegiate background in the lecture rooms of Paris and Bologna./

#+begin_quote
  /By 1300 Europe existed as an identifiable cultural entity. It could be described in more than one way, but some common features of its cultural face are the saints, names, coins, charters and educational practices touched upon in this chapter.

  /The implantation of new aristocracies, encastellation, urbanization, new peasant settlement, the development of documentary literacy, all effected a fundamental transformation in those lands along the periphery of Latin Europe where they were experienced./

  /A dominant, newly arrived population, led by knights and clerics, stiffened by burgesses and some farmers, but still, overall, a minority, confronted a large native majority, alien in language, culture, social structure and, often, religion. The minority had to take care of its own security, ensure its profits and control, suppress or transform the native population. Beyond the sometimes precariously held colonial towns and fiefs lay native polities that were not subjected: Gaelic or Lithuanian kings, Greek or Islamic states, that nurtured long-term plans of revanchism and revival. In polities like these warfare and competition between newcomer and native, settler and indigenous population, were taken for granted as a permanent feature of life./
#+end_quote

- Expansion in the High Middle Ages mostly meant creation of new aristocracies and kingdoms. While some existing monarchies did see their territories increase, by and large the newly conquered lands fell into the hands of new dynasties and created new fiefdoms.

#+begin_quote
  /Conquest, colonization, Christianization: the techniques of settling in new land, the ability to maintain cultural identity through legal forms and nurtured attitudes, the institutions and outlook required to confront the strange or abhorrent, to repress it and live with it, the law and religion as well as the guns and ships. The European Christians who sailed to the coasts of the Americas, Asia and Africa in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries came from a society that was already a colonizing society. Europe, the initiator of one of the world’s major processes of conquest, colonization and cultural transformation, was also the product of one./

* THE SPIRIT OF EARLY CHRISTIAN THOUGHT
** /Robert Louis Wilken/

#+begin_quote
  /Early Christian thought is biblical, and one of the lasting accomplishments of the patristic period was to forge a way of thinking, scriptural in language and inspiration, that gave to the church and to Western civilization a unified an coherent interpretation of the Bible as a whole. Needless to say, this means that any effort to mount an interpretation of the Bible that ignores its first readers is doomed to end up with a bouquet of fragments that are neither the book of the church nor the imaginative wellspring of Western literature, art, and music./
#+end_quote

- Author contends that early Christian thinkers, though influenced by Greco-Roman philosophy, nonetheless developed their own way of thinking. This uniquely Christian way of philosophy should be examined on its own merits, independently of its Aristotelian trappings.
- Well, I didn't expect the book to be unabashedly Christian in bias haha. It's all good, though I would still have preferred a less overtly religious viewpoint.
- Many of the early Christian thinkers were themselves bishops. Their writings, therefore, come from the context of a community that regularly worships God.
- The Church fathers were very explicit in identifying the bread and wine as the /literal/ body and blood of Christ. Considering the author is a Lutheran, this is definitely an expected viewpoint to take.

#+begin_quote
  /Although tradition has to do with handing on practices, teachings, and institutional forms, human beings do the handing on. From the beginning Christians honored those who had given witness to what they had received, most notably the martyrs and holy men and women.

- Well, the author did start referring to later bishops of Rome as pope.
- From the beginnings of Christianity, it has always been argued that faith and reason are incompatible. One counter argument is that, if this were the case, the back-and-forth between early Christian thinkers and pagan philosophers wouldn't have lasted for centuries, and wouldn't have taken the historical significance that it did.
- Augustine argues that authority is a necessity in knowledge. Autonomous reason is unreliable, if not outirght improbable. Truth is not something that can be discovered alone, and is reliant on what others have witnessed and reasoned throughout history.

Those who have gone before teach us how to use such words as God, Spirit, hope, grace, sin, forgiveness, and as we grow accustomed to using them we conform our lives and thoughts to those who have gone before. Memory is essential for Christian thinking, and like all memory it is particular and privileges certain moments and events in the Christian past, certain books and ideas, certain terms, and most of all certain persons. It begins with what has been received./

Even when we seem to achieve a measure of tranquility in our lives, we learn that virtue does not make us immune from pain and sorrow.

- In classical antiquity, and throughout the early Christian history, ethics is instructed and learned primarily through biographies.

* THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS
** /Thomas Kuhn/

#+begin_quote
  /History, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or chronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of science by which we are now possessed. That image has been drawn, even by scientists themselves, mainly from the study of finished scientific achievements as these are recorded in the classics and, more recently, in the textbooks from which each new scientific generation learns to practice its trade. Inevitably, however, the aim of such books is persuasive and pedagogic; a concept of science drawn from them is no more likely to fit the enterprise that produced them than an image of a national culture drawn from a tourist brochure or a language text./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /If science is the constellation of facts, theories, and methods collected in current texts, then scientists are the men who, successfully or not, have striven to contribute one or another element to that particular constellation. Scientific development becomes the piecemeal process by which these items have been added, singly and in combination, to the ever growing stockpile that constitutes scientific technique and knowledge./
#+end_quote

- The author introduces the term *paradigm*, which describes scientific achievements that are (1) unprecedented, and (2) open-ended. This is very significant, as Thomas Kuhn is the one who popularized the term paradigm shift.

- Normal science within specific fields generally deal with expanding and working within the prevailing paradigms, rather than proving / disproving, replicating, or even supplanting, such paradigms.
- Three main problems tackled by normal science (in relation to paradigms): determination of significant facts; matching of facts with theory; articulation of theory.

  /A man may be attracted to science for all sorts of reasons. Among them are the desire to be useful, the excitement of exploring new territory, the hope of finding order, and the drive to test established knowledge. These motives and others besides also help to determine the particular problems that will later engage him. Furthermore, though the result is occasional frustration, there is good reason why motives like these should first attract him and then lead him on./

  /Rules, I suggest, derive from paradigms, but paradigms can guide research even in the absence of rules./
#+end_quote

- Paradigms can be established and firmly embedded within the respective fields, even without clear definitions of its particular characteristics.
- Scientists learn their craft primarily through established knowledge, as well as practical experience. And in the case of experience, they get to closely work within and learn the paradigms without necessarily knowing explicit rules that underpin such paradigms.

#+begin_quote
  /Discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly, i.e., with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induced expectations that govern normal science. It then continues with a more or less extended exploration of the area of anomaly. And it closes only when the paradigm theory has been adjusted so that the anomalous has become the expected. Assimilating a new sort of fact demands a more than additive adjustment of theory, and until that adjustment is completed—until the scientist has learned to see nature in a different way—the new fact is not quite a scientific fact at all./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Philosophers of science have repeatedly demonstrated that more than one theoretical construction can always be placed upon a given collection of data. History of science indicates that, particularly in the early developmental stages of a new paradigm, it is not even very difficult to invent such alternates. But that invention of alternates is just what scientists seldom undertake except during the pre-paradigm stage of their science’s development and at very special occasions during its subsequent evolution. So long as the tools a paradigm supplies continue to prove capable of solving the problems it defines, science moves fastest and penetrates most deeply through confident employment of those tools. The reason is clear. As in manufacture so in science—retooling is an extravagance to be reserved for the occasion that demands it. The significance of crises is the indication they provide that an occasion for retooling has arrived./
#+end_quote

- Putting paradigms to the test does not mean outright rejecting them. When a new theory is put forward, the main goal is to attempt to reconcile it with existing paradigm. Only once it has been resonably proven that the new theory is a much better alternative can the prevailing paradigm be replaced. The displacement of the old paradigm and the establishment of a new one happen simultaneously; they cannot, by virtue of normal scientific processes, coexist.

  /Though history is unlikely to record their names, some men have undoubtedly been driven to desert science because of their inability to tolerate crisis. Though history is unlikely to record their names, some men have undoubtedly been driven to desert science because of their inability to tolerate crisis./

  /Once a first paradigm through which to view nature has been found, there is no such thing as research in the absence of any paradigm. To reject one paradigm without simultaneously substituting another is to reject science itself. That act reflects not on the paradigm but on the man. Inevitably he will be seen by his colleagues as “the carpenter who blames his tools.”/
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a new tradition of normal science can emerge is far from a cumulative process, one achieved by an articulation or extension of the old paradigm. Rather it is a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals, a reconstruction that changes some of the field’s most elementary theoretical generalizations as well as many of its paradigm methods and applications. During the transition period there will be a large but never complete overlap between the problems that can be solved by the old and by the new paradigm. But there will also be a decisive difference in the modes of solution. When the transition is complete, the profession will have changed its view of the field, its methods, and its goals/.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Confronted with anomaly or with crisis, scientists take a different attitude toward existing paradigms, and the nature of their research changes accordingly. The proliferation of competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the expression of explicit discontent, the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals, all these are symptoms of a transition from normal to extraordinary research. It is upon their existence more than upon that of revolutions that the notion of normal science depends./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /One aspect of the parallelism must already be apparent. Political revolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense, often restricted to a segment of the political community, that existing institutions have ceased adequately to meet the problems posed by an environment that they have in part created. In much the same way, scientific revolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense, again often restricted to a narrow subdivision of the scientific community, that an existing paradigm has
ceased to function adequately in the exploration of an aspect of nature to which that paradigm itself had previously led the way. In both political and scientific development the sense of malfunction that can lead to crisis is prerequisite to revolution./
#+end_quote

- Author casts doubt on the idea that history of science is cumulative. Old theories don't just get superseded by better ones. Instead, old theories are completely replaced by new ones, because two paradigms cannot coexist, only one is correct.

#+begin_quote
  /If positivistic restrictions on the range of a theory’s legitimate applicability are taken literally, the mechanism that tells the scientific community what problems may lead to
fundamental change must cease to function. And when that occurs, the community will inevitably return to something much like its pre-paradigm state, a condition in which all members practice science but in which their gross product scarcely resembles science at all. Is it really any wonder that the price of significant scientific advance is a commitment that runs the risk of being wrong?/
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /Neither scientists nor laymen learn to see the world piecemeal or item by item. Except when all the conceptual and manipulative categories are prepared in advance—e.g., for the discovery of an additional transuranic element or for catching sight of a new house—both scientists and laymen sort out whole areas together from the flux of experience. The child who transfers the word ‘mama’ from all humans to all females and then to his mother is not just learning what ‘mama’ means or who his mother is. Simultaneously he is learning some of the differences between males and females as well as something about the ways in which all but one female will behave toward him. His reactions, expectations, and beliefs—indeed, much of his perceived world—change accordingly. By the same token, the Copernicans who denied its traditional title ‘planet’ to the sun were not only learning what ‘planet’ meant or what the sun was. Instead, they were changing the meaning of ‘planet’ so that it could continue to make useful distinctions in a world where all celestial bodies, not just the sun, were seen differently from the way they had been seen before./

  /The depreciation of historical fact is deeply, and probably functionally, ingrained in the ideology of the scientific profession, the same profession that places the highest of all values upon factual details of other sorts./
#+end_quote

- The author notes that history of science, compared with regular history, is very revisionist and intentionally obscures details of its part. History of science is portrayed as being linear and cumulative, and past mistakes and errors are omitted. Unlike regular history, which revels on revolutions, the story of scientific progress is constantly modified to render revolutions invisible, creating a sense of continuity and inevitability.

#+begin_quote
  /No theory ever solves all the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect. On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The transfer of allegiance fom paradigm to paradigm is a conversion experience that cannot be forced. Lifelong resistance, particularly from those whose productive careers have committed them to an older tradition of normal science, is not a violation of scientific standards but an index to the nature of scientific research itself. The source of resistance is the assurance that the older paradigm will ultimately solve all its problems, that nature can be shoved into the box the paradigm provides. Inevitably, at times of revolution, that assurance sems stubborn and pigheaded as indeed it sometimes becomes. But it is also something more. That same assurance is what makes normal or puzzle-solving science possible. And it is only through science that the professional community of scientists succeeds, first, in exploiting the potential scope and precision of the older paradigm and, then, in isolating the difficulty through the study of which a new paradigm may emerge./
#+end_quote

- Paradigms don't always prevail and triumph through scientific pursuit. In many cases, human connection is what ultimately gets the job done. This can be through persuasion with publications and lectures. But it could also be through personal communication, and at times even through just the force of reputation.
- One significant factor for adoption of new paradigm is when it's able to solve the biggest problems of the old paradigm.
- Another consideration for adopting the new paradigm is aesthetics or beauty. This now ties in with Hossenfelder's thesis, who rejects this mindset.

#+begin_quote
  /The early versions of most new paradigms are crude. By the time their full aesthetic appeal can be developed, most of the community has been persuaded by other means. Nevertheless, the importance of aesthetic considerations can sometimes be decisive. Though they often attract only a few scientists to a new theory, it is upon those few that its ultimate triumph may depend. If they had not quickly taken it up for highly individual reasons, the new candidate for paradigm might never have been sufficiently developed to attract the allegiance of the scientific community as a whole./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /But paradigm debates are not really about relative problem-solving ability, though for good reasons they are usually couched in those terms. Instead, the issue is which paradigm should in the future guide research on problems many of which neither competitor can yet claim to resolve completely. A decision between alternate ways of practicing science is called for, and in the circumstances that decision must be based less on past achievement than on future promise. The man who embraces a new paradigm at an early stage must often do so in defiance of the evidence provided by problem-solving. He must, that is, have faith that the new paradigm will succeed with the many large problems that confront it, knowing only that the older paradigm has failed with a few. A decision of that kind can only be made on faith./
#+end_quote

- However science settles its paradigmatic conflicts, ultimately it rests on specialized communities rather than appeals to political and social authorities. Science is inherently self-selecting and way more insulated from external interference than other professional fields.
- Towards the end of the book, Kuhn briefly notes that science as we know it is a product of Western Civilization, and that no other civilization has achieved the level of scientific pursuits that the West has done. West-centric, but not necessarily wrong given the time period the author lived in.

#+begin_quote
  /A scientific community consists, on this view, of the practitioners of a scientific specialty. To an extent unparalleled in most other fields, they have undergone similar educations and professional initiations; in the process they have absorbed the same technical literature and drawn many of the same lessons from it. Usually the boundaries of that standard literature mark the limits of a scientific subject matter, and each community ordinarily has a subject matter of its own./

* WAR AND PUNISHMENT
** /H E Goemans/

#+begin_quote
  /Wars can end only when the minimum terms of settlement of both sides become compatible, when both are asking no more than the other side is willing to give up. Therefore, the fundamental cause of war termination is a change in the minimal demands, that is, the minimum terms of settlement of the combatants./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /The main contribution of this book is the theoretical argument and empirical evidence that the decision to continue fighting or settle depends on the nature of the domestic political regime./
#+end_quote

- The author argues that semirepressive regimes with moderately exclusionary power dynamics have more to lose in a war loss, so they have the greatest incentive to continue fighting.
- Democratic regimes can feel the brunt in a moderate war loss. Autocratic regimes can still suppress opposition in a moderate loss, but a more significant defeat can result in the regime's collapse.

#+begin_quote
  /Neither the terrible havoc wrought by the First World War nor its place as a turning point in history is adequately explained by the events of July 1914. Consider the counterfactual: If the war had ended in November 1914, would this war have been considered as important? Would it even be referred to as "First World War"? To understand why so many people died, and why the war brought such important changes, we need to try to understand why the war lasted so long or, more precisely, why it continued./

  /Historians and political scientists doing historical research can easily fall prey to the subtle problem of selecting the depth of their historical research to fit their expectations. For example, if you cannot find evidence for something you strongly believe, you are easily tempted to argue you cannot find it because it is hidden, and you will keep digging until you find it. In contrast, if you were to immediately find evidence supporting your beliefs, you would be tempted to forsake deeper historical probing that could contradict your beliefs./
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  /War breaks out because one side demands more than the other is willing to concede, that is, because states have incompatible terms of settlement, and each side hopes to procure its demands through war. In other words, each side expects to do better by going to war than by conceding the opponent his demands. Such demands can vary from maintenance of the status quo to unconditional surrender and need not be explicit./

  /Because of the costs of war, the overall pie to be divided between belligerents after war is smaller than it was before the war. In other words, war is a/ negative /sum game.

Although their share of the pie would be the same, they would be dividing a larger pie and would therefore gain in absolute terms. In other words, because fighting is inefficient ex post there should exist ex ante bargains that rational states would both prefer to war./

- Ok I did not expect there to be actual data analysis and statistics in here lol. Though this feels like a show of how data science can be used for historical research, which is interesting for a book published in 2000.
- In the data analysis, Marcos regime was tagged as mixed power that transitioned into dictatorship after moderate defeat in the Vietnam War. Uhm... okay. That's a weird way of looking at it, but okay.
- The significance of this is that it would make him an exception in the author's thesis about mixed regimes suffering the most in a moderate defeat. In fact, the author tagged Marcos and South Korea's Park Chung-hee as the outliers for the group.
- So the author started with this thesis, /then/ chose WW1 as primary case study - not the other way around. This is important context that I admittedly didn't realize early on - this isn't quite a WW1 book, as much as it's a general war studies book.
- I was just thinking of how relevant this study would be on the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Sure enough, the author does have an article - sadly paywalled - about the war. And he seems to take view that - at least as of 2023 - it might be still too early to try a peace deal, which at this point might be a bad route to take for Ukraine.

  /The need to reward the people for their sacrifices led Germany's leaders to formulate war aims to cover the costs of the war. The German regime knew that to stay in power they would have to buy off the domestic opposition after the war. The enormous costs of the war gave the regime only two options. They could buy off the people with real political concessions, specifically a reform of the Prussian franchise and the introduction of parliamentary government. Alternatively, they could buy off the people with the spoils of a victorious war. The German regime could not grant political concessions to the opposition without endangerng their own political survival. That left them only one possibility to buy off the opposition: gains at the expense of their external enemies, in other words, high war aims./

- By early 1917, the German leaders have grown ever more pessimistic of the outcome of the war. It's this pessimism that pushed them to go for the high risk strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare.

  /Germany's increased territorial demands at the end of 1916, such as the additional land demanded from Poland, were intended to reward the populace in the form of land grants and settlements.

- The author argued that Hindenburg's reputation was used as an insurance for their war aims. Hindenburg, though himself taking on extremist positions in  terms of war conduct and aims, is considered a competent leader across the political spectrum, not just among conservatives but also among the moderates. This meant that in the event Hindenburg has to endorse a "meager peace", his reputation alone would be enough to convince the populace to accept such outcome.
- Russia is classified as mixed regime. It's authoritarian in theory, but by the beginning of the 20th century Imperial Russia has become an inefficient police state, unable to effectively stave off widespread opposition at times.
- Even before the war, Russian leadership was aware that they have slim chances of suppressing a peasant revolution. As war went on, they increased war aims as a way to capture popular support, to no avail. By 1916, it was clear that war defeat would result in a revolution that topples the Trarist regime, and they will be unable to prevent such a scenario.
- Third Republic political makeup is kinda similar in the Philippines today lol. Politicians switch alliances when convenient, and there's a ton or parties in the Parliament, making it a very pluralistic system. The stability of the Third Republic is that successive Cabinets featured the same set of personalities over and over.

  /There hardly can be any doubt that the mutinies presented French leaders with some unpleasant new information: French relative strength and cost tolerance were lower than they had previously estimated. The French army was simply not willing to lose so much blood for so few expected gains./

  /In the period between May-June and November 1917, a deep feeling of depression spread over France. With the repeated promises that victory was near and that the next offensive would be the last now totally discredited, the French populace became unwilling to bear quietly any longer the privations imposed by the war./
#+end_quote

- By early 1918, the French public actually has more information about an vimpending German offensive than the Geman populace themselves.
- Overall, throughout the war the French government was more worried about international consequences rather than domestic ones. France was more concerned with the balance of powers in Europe and beyond, and less on how the people themselves would react to either victory or defeat.
- Initial French war aims included the return of Alsace-Lorraine's 1790 borders. As war went on, and as pessimism crept in, the demand was revised down to 1870 Alsace-Lorraine, which had substantially smaller portion of the Saar coalfields.
- Author countered the argument that Alsace-Lorraine was used to buy off the populace and prevent popular unrest. The author argued that there was no major popular pressure from any sector to recover the region. Or rather, the French government did not feel significant threat of overthrow due to an inability to take Alsace-Lorraine. The region's primary significance is strategic and economic, and pressure from below did not affect such considerations.

#+begin_quote
  /In France neither the opposition from the right, mainly supporters of the army and the Church, nor the socialist opposition from the left posed a real threat to the survival of the French regime. It is not surprising, then, that war aims never became a central issue in the domestic political struggle. Demands for rewards for the sacrifices imposed by the war could be met by relatively minor domestic political concessions./
#+end_quote

- Another proof that the French government did not face threat of domestic revolution is that none of the Prime Ministers throughout the war sought to stay in power. In fact, there have been five such Prime Ministers during the conflict, from varying parties, and in any case any attempt to perpetuate in power would have been checked by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
- British Empire is tagged as Democracy. While suffrage is far from universal - it's only for men who own property - the populace is generally well represented in Parliament. And unlike in Germany, British Parliament has actual policy-making powers.

- Britain wanted to maximize American participation to their advantage by pursuing amalgamation: keep the American forces plenty enough to cover manpower shortages, but small enough that the US cannot have greater influence in possible postwar bargaining. The author then notes that at one point in late 1917, Britain has little problem bringing in 500k American troops to Europe when necessity came up.
- The British government proved willing to make domestic concessions to aid the conduct of war. In particular, mass conscription was supplemented with universal suffrage and large scale social welfare programs that extended beyond the war.
- Britain was very concerned about international consequences of the war, and their status as a great power. The British are afraid of Germany being vindicated for violating Belgian neutrality, and its precedence for further German imperial designs in Europe. But also, the British were fearful that Russia's victory over the Ottoman Empire would be a major threat to the British Raj, while also throwing off the balance of power in the Mediterranean.

#+begin_quote
  /Ludendorff preferred to fight on in an almost hopeless cause, even to lose the war, rather than to reform the Prussian franchise.

  /It is striking to note how the British were willing to offer the very thing the German leaders wanted to avoid at all costs: a far-reaching reform of the franchise. This willingness to offer concessions, seen in combination with Britain's prewar political difficulties, clearly shows that it is indeed regime type and not the presence or absence of prewar crises that caused the different reactions to unfavorable new information of Germany and Britain.

- Lenin knew that Russian Army has become too weak to fight, and continuing the war will inevitably result in massive Russian defeat and collpase of the newly-established Soviet state. He instead banked on a future reversal of fortunes.
- For their part, Germany could've extracted more favorable terms from Brest-Litovsk. They chose not to, and tried to settle the treaty sooner. This is because they desperately need to transfer a vast amount of troops to the Western Front, and pressing for more demands will just further delay the mobilization plans.
- On the other hand, Germany did not try to offer peace with the Western Allies because they need the higher war aims to cover the costs of war and buy off domestic opposition. Ludendorff has also already been planning new offensives on the West at the time of Brest-Litovsk, and he wanted to make the gamble that the offensive could give Germany a victory and better position to bargain.

#+begin_quote

  /The unfavorable new information on the last days of September forced the German leadership to draw two unpleasant conclusions. First, defeat in the war was now inevitable.

  /A bargaining space was finally created in October and November because the German regime realized the war was inevitbaly lost. No more high-variance strategies could conceivably save them.

France, Britain, and the United States meanwhile increased their demands but stopped (just barely) short of asking for unconditional surrender—even though the Germans would have accepted—because of intra-alliance pressures and fears the others would gain most from continued was while they would have to pay most of the costs./

* WORLDMAKING IN THE LONG GREAT WAR
** /Jonathan Wyrtzen/

#+begin_quote
  /The conventional 1914–1918 World War I bracket is limited by two entwined biases that distort our overall understanding of the conflict and warp it in specific ways with respect to the Middle East. The first is a bias toward a judicial definition of wartime that is bookended by the dates of formal declarations, armistices, and treaties carried out by recognized state actors. Using this shorthand occludes complicated realities of continuing violence and political fluidity that extend beyond those dates. The second bias is a myopic privileging of the beginning and ending of hostilities in a single theater of the war to periodize the whole of the conflict. In this case, fixating on the Western Front diverts attention from what was happening in the conflict’s other interconnected maritime and overland theaters, minimizing the true interregional scope of World War I./

#+begin_quote
  /De-Europeanizing the Great War by Ottomanizing it underscores how the greater Middle East was central to the causes, course of, and outcomes of World War I as a whole. For Middle East history, thinking in terms of a Long Great War offers an essential framework for identifying, analyzing, and interpreting the complicated processes through which the region’s political order was unmade, reimagined, and remade in a period that extends beyond that conventional dating./
#+end_quote

- The book is focused on the Middle East and North Africa for periodizing the First World War. Interestingly, Morocco is used for anchoring both the start (1911) and end (1934) of the Long Great War.
- The author scrutinizes and rejects the standard Sykes-Picot narrative. Notes that it exemplifies the usual problem with periodizing the War to 1914-1918: the narrative assumes that treaties are ironclad and reflect realities on the ground (they don't).

#+begin_quote
  /At its core, it leans heavily on the judicial fallacy already discussed: wartime agreements and postwar treaties are presumed to actually do work, converting more or less directly into realities on the ground. Narrating a progression of discrete events in this way, however, glosses over major gaps between aspirations and reality, concealing the complex and contingent processes actually happening over time./

  /At its core, this book’s counternarrative focuses on how war unmakes political orders and how it provides the conditions in which new political worlds can be made. It traces how three integral processes of this worldmaking—state formation, political identity formation, and territorial boundary formation—shaped the modern Middle East. In this account, interactions involving and entangling international and local actors drove these entwined, but distinct, processes. European colonial powers are neither all powerful nor absent but, rather, provincialized as one set among many contributing actors, including a cast of local leaders and movements, whose power also had potentials and limits./

  /The political boundaries of the modern Middle East, too, were remade through war, not secret agreements or the peace settlement.

- Author notes that Germany's first attack against French forces wasn't in mainland Europe, but in Algeria. RMS Breslau and Goeben attacked embarkation ports on 3 August 1914 to prevent transfer of French troops from Africa to Europe.
- Crucially, these two ships would later also cause the official entry of Ottoman Empire to the conflict, when they entered the Dardanelles and transferred command to the Ottoman Navy.
- By start of 1915, the Ottomans would suffer a major defeat in the Caucasus, in a battle lead by Enver Pasha against the Russians. This defeat would be blamed on Armenians, and would be a catalyst to the genocide presided over by the Ottoman government.
- Long before the discovery of oil in Mesopotamia, the British Empire already has protected interests in the region. Mainly, control of Mesopotamia ensured dominance in shipping, as well as keeping other powers such as Russia far from the British Raj.

  /The Ottoman Empire faced a multifronted struggle, on their own territory, to a degree unique among the belligerents in World War I, most of whom only had one or two active military theaters. On almost all of these fronts, the Ottomans were able, remarkably, to hold their own./

- The Ottoman fronts were:
  - Caucasus
  - Dardanelles
  - Mesopotamia
  - Northern Africa
  - Greater Syria via Sinai

  /In the Middle East, the war had required total mobilization of the general population, which had suffered tremendously because of food shortages exacerbated by the Allied blockade and the horrific purges of suspect populations, forced resettlement, and genocide of Armenian and Assyrian populations  the empire. On each of the fighting fronts discussed—in the Caucasus and eastern Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Northern Africa, and in Arabia and Syria—the way the war played out transformed political horizons. Rather than being fixed, these boundaries of collective political solidarity were in tremendous flux within the fluid post-armistice environment./

- The people within Greater Syria region are well aware of foreign plans for partitioning the Middle East. In particular, details about the Balfour Declaration and the Sykes-Picot agreement spread across the region after the Bolshevik government declassified war-related treaties and accords.
- The 1919 King-Crane Commission showed that: majority of the population in Greater Syrian region favored independence; that they were wary, even opposed, to the Zionist program put forward by the European powers; and that the British and the French are asserting their mandate over these peoples.
- By 1919, the most popular plan among the peoples of Greater Syria is a unified Arab monarchy under King Faisal. A second option is still unified Syria, but under American supervision.
- Armenian and Kurdish delegations received sympathetic audience in Paris. However, very little was done on the ground to address their concerns.
- The Allies partitioned Anatolia among themselves, and Greek forces also moved on their own to occupy Izmir. Resistance to continued Allied occupation was organized and lead by Mustafa Kemal.
- The Syrian Congress declared independence on 8 May 1920, with King Faisal as head of state. The French forces moved to quell the independece movement, and in a few months ousted Faisal and gained control over Greater Syria, placing it under French mandate.

  /The cost of imposing the mandate in Iraq had been high, with six thousand Iraqi lives lost and five hundred British and Indian soldiers. Monetarily it cost the British one hundred million pounds in direct and indirect costs, five times the budgeted annual allotment for the whole mandate administration. On the Iraqi side, the experience of mobilization, military confrontation, and brutal suppression up and down the Tigris and Euphrates, though still largely local, also strengthened a nascent larger collective solidarity./

- Unlike with the rest of the Middle East, only one European power staked claims on the Arabian peninsula: the British Empire. The conflict in the region will be between proxies of two British political groups.
- The Cairo Office supported Sharif Husayn of Hejaz. The India Office supported Ibn Saud of the Najd. The Paris Conference ultimately recognized Sharif Husayn's Kingdom of Hejaz.

  /Much more than the infamous Sykes-Picot Agreement, it was in the League of Nations–ratified Sèvres treaty that the European powers actually drew lines on the map, negotiated which colonial power got what, and determined which local claims were recognized over others. As a “final” settlement, however, the article-by-article peace terms set out on paper and signed that August glossed over the complex, continuing wartime interactions in the region that were, even at the moment the treaty was being signed, rapidly making the treaty terms a dead letter./

- Egypt became the British launch point for Ottoman campaigns. The country and its people felt that their heavy involvement and sacrifices in the War should be reciprocated with independence.
- The arrest of Egyptian delegation sparked massive protests and anti-British attacks. The British carefully considered their predicament, and ultimately relented, giving Egypt nominal independence on 22 February 1922.

  /Though settled in international law, Morocco was far from a settled polity on the ground. The French, Spanish, and Alawites (the Moroccan dynasty) were all far from exercising much actual state control, and Morocco itself was far from even being a clearly defined territorial entity. The “Morocco” cursorily referred to in the Sèvres treaty had been split up in 1912 in complicated ways among French, Spanish, and international (around Tangier) zones, but these zones’ actual boundaries remained fuzzy./

- France and Spain maintained their respective areas of control in Morocco. The French side has a more centralized lowlands region including Rabat, and a mountainous region where they are content with loose control over the tribes.
- Spanish troops, after the War, pushed to establish control over the mountainous regions in their zone. This ignited uprising among the tribes, which united under the leadership of Mohamed bin Abd el-Krim.
- The Spanish were repeatedly pushed back, suffering massive defeats, and even French cooperation was not enough. In early 1920s Abd el-Krim lead the creation of al-Jumhuriyya al-Riffia, the Rif Republic.

  /The Arabian Peninsula was one of the few places in the greater Middle East in which there was no European colonial state in formation attempting to directly reshape the postwar map. A British zone of influence in the peninsula was internationally accepted (though Italy made a play for influence in Yemen), yet within this zone, outside of the Aden Protectorate (established in 1839), the British acted more as a referee than an active player in struggles amongst multiple local emerging polities./

  /The onset of the war, the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, and the increase of revenue and support streams from external sources had made new political visions thinkable for multiple local actors in the Arabian Peninsula. These included the Hashemites in the Hejaz, the Rashidis in Ha’il, the Saudis in the Najd, the Sabbagh family in Kuwait, the various emirates between Kuwait and Oman, the Idrissid amir in Asir, and the Imam in Yemen. In stark contrast to other regions where local emerging polities (like the Rif or Sanusi proto-states) had to compete against European colonial states, in Arabia they had to compete with each other./

- Turkey and Soviet Russia sorted their claims in the Caucasian region through the Treaty of Moscow in 1921. Later that year, Turkey reaffirmed the boundaries together with Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, in the Treaty of Kars.
- To bolster his revolution against the European powers, Mustafa Kemal initially emphasized Turkish pluralism, where Turks, Kurds, and other ethnic groups are united against their conquerors.
- Once the Republic of Turkey has established itself, however, Kemal and his government pivoted to Turkish homogenization and suppression of ethnic pluralism, asserting the use of Turkish language throughout the country inlcuding in Kurdistan.
- Kemal's vision for Turkey began with multiethnic Islamic country, but later evolved to become Turkish nationalist secular republic.
- Both Turkey and Britain laid claim on Kurdistan, and mobilized their own Kurdish factions to vie control for the region. Turkey's suppression of Kurdish sympathies in its border ultimately worked against them, as the League of Nations deemed it better to give Mosul to British-controlled Iraq instead.
- By 1925, the Rif Repulic was able to establish infrastructure to assert its territorial integrity, stationing border and customs guards and building some usable road networks.
- Abd el-Krim also recognized the significance of international recognition, and employed diplomatic means to assert and gain support for independence. This diplomatic campaign indeed garnered support from all over the world.
- Combined French and Spanish forces gradually broke through the Rif Republic, and Abd el-Krim surrendered in 1926, though he also encouraged individual tribes to continue resistance. The Rif Republic was finally suppressed in 1927.
- European powers honed their aerial warfare capabilities in the Middle East, where planes were greatly used against the various rebel forces in the region.

  /The war drove transformational state, collective identity, and boundary-making processes for all the parties involved. The extended wartime experience has for generations since shaped notions of collective identity. The Rif resistance also fired the imagination of urban and rural communities elsewhere in Morocco for anticolonial struggle that would take various forms over subsequent decades. For the Spanish and French, the threat of the Rif Republic forced massive mobilization and massive expenditures to extend the reach of the colonial states in their respective zones. It was also in and through the exigencies of total colonial war that spatializing technologies like cartography, surveying, aerial photography, physical occupation, and scientific surveying had to be deployed to delineate and monopolize state space in the rugged interior terrain of northern Morocco./

  /These nearly synchronic Kurdish, Riffi, and Syrian jihads—the term most of their participants used to refer to these struggles—launched in the spring and summer of 1925 gave lie to any presumption that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne had finally crystallized the post-Ottoman political order of the modern Middle East. The Lausanne treaty officially recognized the dramatic transformations the Turkish Republic had achieved, but, as with Sèvres, there still remained a huge gap between the treaty terms and still unsettled political realities in eastern Anatolia, Greater Syria, and Northwest Africa. At friction points across the region, viable colonial and local polities that emerged in the wake of the fall of the Ottoman Empire continued to clash in crescendoing waves of large-scale military conflict in the mid and late 1920s./

- Ibn Saud and his Ikhwan allies disagreed on the nature of their territorial borders. The former wanted well-defined borders, the latter want continuous expansions. Ibn Saud used this conflict to consolidate power and fully expand his territory to encompass the Arabian peninsula. In 1932, Ibn Saud established his consolidated state's identity as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
- Ibn Saud has incurred large debt from the wars he fought in the creation of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To pay for these, he forged an oil agreement with Standard Oil, marking the start of the Kingdom’s petroleum industry, that continues to shape the Middle East to this day.

  /By the mid-1930s, the region-wide period of sustained wartime catalyzed in 1911 by French and Italian expansion into Northern Africa, which had unmade the previous political order from Morocco to Iran and through which the greater Middle East was remade into an interstate system of local and colonial polities, drew to a close. Though the region would again soon be swept up into another world war and tumultuous struggles for decolonization, none of these conflicts would fundamentally transform the political topography reimagined and forged through the Long Great War./

  /By tracing out how the Long Great War unmade political worlds and served as the crucible in which new political worlds were imagined and put in motion, this book’s alternate narrative has shown that the new map of the modern Middle East was not imposed but reshaped over time as rival colonial and local clashed violently into the 1920s and 1930s. States, identities, and spatial boundaries were transformed through war, not a peace settlement./

  /The Sykes-Picot myth primes us presuppositionally with an intuitive Edenic counterfactual in which “natural” borders could have been drawn but were transgressed. The implicit assumption is that some sort of primordial post-Ottoman ethnonational communities in fact existed and were spatially bounded, and, by extension, that the colonial and local actors had fixed ideas and preferences that were diametrically opposed. This ignores the historical record, traced throughout this book, of colonial and local actors repeatedly recalculating and reimagining new political futures, with adjusted social and physical boundaries, based on opportunity contexts that shifted as competing projects came into conflict and new facts on the ground were established./

  /What the European colonial powers did wrong was to repeatedly, persistently, and violently intervene, shaping the region’s political institutions by buttressing authoritarian colonial state structures whose legacies continue to impact the modern Middle East.

  /What the British did wrong was to pursue an ambivalent, at times schizophrenic, ethnoreligious divide-and-rule policy in which they never midwifed representative political structures through which a Palestinian Jewish and Arab unified polity could emerge.

  /It is important to not veer too far toward naively idealizing the self-determining political futures that “might have been” across the region. History rarely offers up black and white stories with clear good and bad guys; the Long Great War framework, which itself contains multiple counterfactuals to the Sykes-Picot narrative, shows us how much the making of the modern Middle East is a study in greys./

  /But, in finally forgoing the myth that the region’s "Fall" is because of the original sin of imposed, artificial borders, we can  that the Middle East is neither perpetually cursed by the Great War legacy nor think that its salvation lies in either external powers or local actors simply redrawing these boundaries. The deeper issue is political. Being able to see how new worlds were created in the Middle East in the Long Great War helps us see that they can be reimagined and remade now and in the future—and therein lies hope./
